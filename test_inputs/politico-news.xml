<br />
<p>Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) will oppose Neera Tanden's nomination to lead the White House budget office, casting serious doubt on her ability to get confirmed and making her President Joe Biden's first pick who could fall short in the Senate.</p>
<p>Manchin's opposition presents a major problem for Tanden, given that Democrats only hold a 50-seat majority in the Senate. Without Manchin’s vote, Tanden likely would need at least one Senate Republican to back her in order to win approval to lead Biden's Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>In a statement, Manchin said that he had reviewed Tanden’s previous tweets criticizing his colleagues, including Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).</p>
<p>“I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget,” Manchin said. “For this reason, I cannot support her nomination. As I have said before, we must take meaningful steps to end the political division and dysfunction that pervades our politics.”</p>
<p>Biden could theoretically use a recess appointment to make Tanden head of OMB. But that could bring procedural hurdles given Democrats’ narrow Senate majority. It could, however, be the only option. Finding Republican support for Tanden might prove a heavy lift, especially now that she doesn’t have full support from Senate Democrats.</p>
<p>The White House so far is not conceding defeat. When asked whether he’d pull Tanden’s nomination Friday evening, Biden replied “no.” </p>
<p>“Neera Tanden is an accomplished policy expert who would be an excellent Budget Director and we look forward to the committee votes next week and to continuing to work toward her confirmation through engagement with both parties,” added White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. </p>
<p>The Senate Homeland Security and Budget Committees are expected to vote on her nomination next week.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Tanden <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/10/sander-tanden-confirmation-468350" target="_blank"> <u>took heat from both sides of the aisle</u></a> during two confirmation hearings in which Republicans and Sanders both excoriated her social media history, criticizing her for past remarks about both Republicans and progressives as the president and CEO of the Center for American Progress.</p>
<p>“Your attacks were not just made against Republicans,” Sanders said during her appearance before the Senate Budget Committee. “There were vicious attacks against progressives, people who I have worked with — me personally.”</p>
<p>Sanders has not yet indicated whether he’ll support Tanden’s nomination. But he told CNN Friday that he will be speaking with her again early next week about her vision for OMB. </p>
<p>During the hearings, Tanden<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/10/sander-tanden-confirmation-468350" target="_blank"> <u>stressed repeatedly</u></a> that she regretted the tweets and her criticism of lawmakers wouldn’t have any bearing on how she leads OMB or steers major policy and funding issues that require bipartisan support to clear both chambers. </p>
<p>“I feel badly about that,” she said of her harsh words. “My approach will be radically different.”</p>
<p>Other Democrats have labeled GOP criticism of Tanden’s tweeting as hypocrisy, citing Republican silence about former President Donald Trump’s own penchant for going after members of his own party</p>
<p>Tanden also faced bipartisan scrutiny for the millions of dollars in corporate donations her liberal think tank has accepted, which she pledged would have zero influence on her decision-making as OMB director.</p>
<p>“I’m very glad to see that Senator Manchin has decided to put people before politics and make sure that someone beholden to corporate interests and foreign governments doesn’t become the next OMB director,” said Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.), the ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee.</p>
<p>OMB is a critical agency for any president, charged with carrying out an administration’s fiscal and regulatory agenda, and its directorship is a Cabinet-level post. For Biden, the agency will be at the heart of his administration’s response to the pandemic and the ensuing economic crisis.</p>
<p>Manchin’s opposition incensed liberal advocates, who’ve praised Tanden’s broad knowledge of policy and familiarity with how government assistance can help families. </p>
<p>“I am appalled by Joe Manchin voting against Neera Tanden for OMB, a committed progressive after he voted for Bill Barr and others,” tweeted Ilyse Hogue, president of the abortion-rights group NARAL. “How about assessing her work, competence and vision instead [of] the tone [of] her tweets? Stop sinking good women because they are outspoken.”</p>
<p>Manchin is one of the few swing votes left in the Senate when it comes to nominees. Among the Trump nominees he supported was the former president’s pick for ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, who had a controversial and highly partisan Twitter feed. </p>
<p>The president’s pick for deputy director at OMB is expected to face a more amicable confirmation process than Tanden. Biden’s nominee for that No. 2 position, Shalanda Young, was an aide on the House Appropriations Committee for 14 years and most recently served as Democratic staff director of the panel, helping broker bipartisan aid deals and government funding packages.</p>
<p>Manchin hinted<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/30/manchin-harris-covid-relief-464011" target="_blank"> <u>at some dissatisfaction</u></a> with the White House last month after Vice President Kamala Harris appeared on TV in his home state to pitch the Biden administration's Covid relief plan. </p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't believe it,&quot; Manchin told the same local station that Harris gave her interview to. &quot;No one called me.&quot;</p>

        <media:title>In this image from video, Sen. Ted Cruz walks to check in for his flight back to the U.S., at Cancun International Airport in Cancun, Mexico, on Thursday.</media:title>

<br />
<p>Three weeks before Sen. Ted Cruz embarked on his<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/02/19/disaster-vacation-ted-cruz-politics-history-470108" target="_blank"> ill-fated Cancun trip</a> to escape the aftermath of Texas’s devastating winter storm, the elite K-12 Houston private school attended by his two daughters emailed a Covid warning to parents about international travel.</p>
<p>The bottom line: St. John’s School students who travel internationally must quarantine for 7 to 10 days upon their return. And they won’t be able to even learn online while in isolation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000177-bc00-dcf6-a7f7-bf43953f0000" target="_blank">rules</a>, pegged to CDC guidelines, were sent Jan. 30 in reaction to a controversy that gripped the school after its winter break, when the 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> grade classes had to promptly quarantine because students attended holiday parties that led to multiple Covid-positive infections.</p>
<p>A divide had formed between the parents and students who followed the safety guidelines and those who flouted them — a microcosm of the broader societal conflict that plays out daily across the nation.</p>
<p>Cruz’s trip this week wrenched that divide wide open. As newly released<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/ted-cruz-storm-cancun.html" target="_blank"> text messages</a> and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/19/ted-cruz-cant-escape-mexico-vacation-memes" target="_blank"> Cruz-mocking memes</a> exploded on social media, St. John’s parents demanded the school enforce the safety rules that will keep his kids out of class, taking the scandal out of the political realm and into his home.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/63/a4/b5441e5e471b9768d8ab4bb03c86/210219-cruz-home-ap-773.jpg" />
<br />
<p>“At the end of the day, he’s taking this heat for using his children as an excuse for taking a vacation. And that’s a mistake,” said Lara Hollingsworth, a parent of three kids at the school. “From a parent standpoint, all I’m asking is the school follow the CDC guidelines, and I need to say I have no reason to believe they won’t.”</p>
<p>Cruz has long held a reputation as a polarizing politician <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/why-ted-cruz-loves-to-be-hated-213859/" target="_blank">people love to hate</a>, and Hollingsworth said some of his critics at the school believe he displayed “hypocritical behavior.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got someone out here saying, ‘I did this to be a good dad.’ No one is trying to dispute that,” she said. “The question is are you fully aware of the consequences of what you did? Does it make you a bad parent? No. Does it make you a bad senator? Maybe.”</p>
<p>The topic of the Cruz family’s travel became so hot that administrators of the St. John’s School Parents Facebook page closed down comments Friday on a post that referred “to this recent communication from the school regarding ... advisories (including CDC requirements links) for international travel.”</p>
<p>Under the guidance, any international traveler who returns to the United States must quarantine or isolate for 7 to 10 days after returning to in-person instruction.</p>
<p>A Cruz spokesman said the senator’s “daughters plan to follow the St. John’s policy.”</p>
<br />
<p>St. John’s administrators could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>When Cruz arrived back in Texas after a day in Mexico, the senator acknowledged Thursday to the press that the trip “was obviously a mistake and in hindsight I wouldn't have done it.&quot; He also has expressed regrets for criticizing California in the past for its power problems, as old statements of him railing against vacationing politicians have been flung back in his face.</p>
<p>“Let's be honest, you're in Cancun ... you’re at the beach drinking daiquiris,” Cruz joked in a 2015 <a href="https://twitter.com/American_Bridge/status/1362782071509368832" target="_blank">interview</a> with a conservative commentator while mocking a climate change summit. </p>
<p>The video clip was unearthed by the liberal group American Bridge, which also obtained the text messages his wife sent to neighbors ahead of the trip. The messages were first reported by the New York Times.</p>
<p>“The question isn’t who leaked the text messages. It’s who didn’t leak them? It’s an example of how universally reviled Ted Cruz is in public and private life, and even in his own neighborhood,” said Max Steele, a communications advisor for American Bridge, who recalled Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/26/politics/lindsey-graham-ted-cruz-dinner" target="_blank">quip</a> in 2016 about his colleague: “If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you.”</p>
<br />
<p>Against that backdrop, Cruz has been forced to go on a mea culpa media tour to undo some of the damage as he positions himself for a second presidential bid in 2024.</p>
<p>Not everyone is willing to forgive so soon.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel badly for him,” said Victoria Konar, a parent of a senior at St. John’s School.</p>
<p>“You start with the fact that there are people ticked off by those who think they’re the VIPs at this school who don’t want to be bothered to follow the rules because it infringes on their social life. Then you’ve got people on top of that who don’t like Ted Cruz,” she said. “And then you have everyone irritated because they’re freezing to death and can't bathe and can’t eat and he’s going off to the Ritz Carlton in Cancun and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/19/politics/ted-cruz-cancun-texas/index.html" target="_blank">lying</a> about it.”</p>
<p>Konar, Hollingsworth and a third parent who spoke on condition of anonymity with POLITICO praised the school for its Covid safety measures.</p>
<p>“It’s enraging to see this politician go out of the country like this and there’s a concern that he would be putting the school at risk if he was trying to sneak out,” the parent said. “There are just a huge number of people who are very angry at Ted Cruz, like most people in the United States.”<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Texans have long prided themselves on bucking federal oversight and standing apart from the rest of the country. But this week revealed the risk that comes with that independence.</description>

<br />
<p>EL PASO — More than 4 million people across Texas lost power on Monday in the middle of a deadly winter snowstorm. In Austin, my father-in-law spent hours desperately searching for a place to stay and a way to get there, before making it to the safety of a hotel with the help of a heroic Uber driver. Friends texted me stories about putting on all their clothes and huddling under covers with their kids, braving icy roads to get to a relative’s house where the lights were still on or making use of their formerly decorative fireplaces. They were the lucky ones.</p>
<p>Here, the lights were on, and that was how I learned that my new hometown, El Paso, is not just in a different time zone from the rest of Texas—it’s also on a different power grid. The winter storm hit this border town, too. But even as demand surged, there were sources to help fill the need, and the outages were relatively minor.</p>
<p>El Paso’s power lines are attached to the Western grid, which connects 14 states and parts of Canada and Mexico. The rest of Texas, however, is on its own grid—making it the only state that tries to manage its power independent from the rest of the United States. It was this energy grid that failed so catastrophically as people cranked up their heat while energy sources literally froze. The rest of the country experienced power outages too, but none as long-lasting or severe as in Texas—none that have turned into a humanitarian crisis. According to the operator of the Texas grid, the situation was so dire that the state avoided a months-long blackout by just a minute or two.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/7e/e3/07f1da5a423892ec37940beee310/ap21047672588529.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Republican Governor Greg Abbott blamed the grid’s managers—an independent nonprofit called the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT—calling on Wednesday for the council’s leadership to resign. He and other Republican leaders here also pointed to the state’s frozen wind turbines and condemned the rise of clean energy—going as far as to target the Green New Deal, even though it’s a proposal, not federal law. (While the frozen turbines were a factor, natural gas wells, oil pipelines and coal-burning plants still dominate the Texas grid, and they froze, too.)</p>
<p>But another way to see it is that the problem was the Texas system itself. With a standalone grid, and no access to power plants elsewhere, Texas couldn’t draw power from other states and was forced to switch off power for whole swaths of the state to prevent permanent damage to the grid. The state also could have required energy producers to prepare better for the cold weather, as other states do, but that didn’t happen either.</p>
<p>Texans have long seen this independence as a point of pride. Texas’ independent grid was <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/curious-texas/2021/02/16/how-did-texas-wind-up-on-its-own-electrical-grid-curious-texas-investigates/" target="_blank">created a century ago</a> in the image that Texans have of themselves: standalone, free from federal oversight and largely deregulated. But this week’s blackout has come as a rebuke to that idea—or, at least, highlighted the limits of Texas as a brash, go-it-alone state, big enough not to have to rely on the rest of America. For six days, people living in the energy capital of the world have been without electricity in freezing cold temperatures. About 200,000 Texans are still without power, but millions are now without water, too—with lowest-income households hit hardest.</p>

<br />
<p>“It’s tougher when you aren’t interconnected and not part of the mix,” says Pat Wood III, CEO of Dallas-based Hunt Energy Network and a former Texas and federal energy regulator. Wood, who was appointed to the Public Utility Commission of Texas by Governor George W. Bush, lost power for 36 straight hours in Houston before rolling blackouts kicked in on Tuesday. “At least you could recharge your stuff and cook dinner,” he says.</p>
<p>“I think a go-it-alone attitude within a republic of states is always a very tricky situation,” adds Carlos Kevin Blanton, head of the history department at Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>As politicians call for investigations and committee hearings—with ERCOT as the focal point—energy experts say the council’s leaders are being used as a scapegoat. ERCOT, which runs as a nonprofit with a board of directors, is overseen by the state Legislature and the state’s Public Utility Commission, whose members the governor appoints; all three of the commission’s current members are Abbott appointees. An investigation might turn up more details, and possibly some serious failures on ERCOT’s part, but it is state executives who ultimately make the decisions about the Texas energy grid.</p>
<p>“I always viewed ERCOT as the air traffic controllers and plumbing contractors for the state’s electric grid, but the policymakers are the legislators and the [public utility commission],” says Ray Sullivan, who served as chief of staff to former Governor Rick Perry and also worked for Bush. Sullivan says he doesn’t recall having a single meeting with ERCOT staff when he was working for Perry.</p>
<p>Texas took control of its grid in the 1930s after the Federal Power Act was passed to regulate interstate electricity sales. ERCOT was created in 1970 and took on more responsibility for managing the Texas grid over the following decades. The current structure of Texas’ energy system has its roots in the mid-1990s, when the state government moved to deregulate the energy market here. ERCOT at that point became the country’s first independent service operator. According to both Sullivan and Wood, Republicans and Democrats agreed back then on restructuring the state’s power industry and breaking up utility monopolies in an effort to make the market more competitive.</p>
<p>“It didn’t get that partisan,” Wood recalls. “Everybody agreed wholesale competition made sense.” A 1995 law required the state to study connecting the Texas grid to the rest of the country, but the resulting report recommended against it so the state could maintain access to cheaper power, according to Wood.</p>
<p>A series of reforms over the next few legislative sessions in the late 1990s and early 2000s—the regular session lasts only 140 days every other year—focused on keeping energy costs low, especially for industrial customers, and bringing in new power companies. The reforms helped to usher in new technology, like wind and solar energy, while helping to meet demand for the state’s burgeoning population—and keeping prices low.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/62/4c/728675e442048d182fd259488817/ap101123163384.jpg" />
<br />
<p>ERCOT’s role was and is essentially as the intermediary, mostly acting as a broker between energy buyers and sellers. It was never tasked with deciding on the state’s overarching approach to energy policy; it just carries it out. While ERCOT does have to make sure the grid is reliable, it can’t force changes such as infrastructure upgrades.</p>
<p>The trade-off that Texas lawmakers and regulators have made over the years, says Michael Webber, an energy resources professor at the University of Texas at Austin, is focusing on cost over reliability. Some states like Georgia require operators to maintain energy reserves almost double what Texas requires. This costs energy companies more money, but it also ensures that a grid is more reliable. Treating turbines, natural gas wells, coal plants and nuclear plants so that they can withstand winter weather also costs money. The state government in Texas, which has no state income tax, has avoided budgeting funds to prepare the grid for winter, knowing that customers would have faced higher bills.</p>
<p>“There is always a balance between just going as far as you can and keeping the market affordable,” says Texas energy lobbyist Michael Jewell.</p>
<p>After a major winter storm knocked out power in Texas almost exactly a decade ago, federal regulators <a href="https://www.ferc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-04/08-16-11-report.pdf" target="_blank">called on the state</a> to fortify its grid against deep freezes. But the federal government had no authority to mandate such measures. Wood says this is typical of Texas’ approach to federal oversight. Even though the federal intervention was “relatively benign,” Texas still didn’t want to deal with it. “I just threw my hands up in the air,” he says.</p>
<p>Even at the height of the crisis this week, <a href="https://www.republicanleader.gov/whats-up-in-texas/" target="_blank">Rick Perry said</a> Texans would rather go without power for days than deal with federal energy regulations. Never mind that Texas readily accepts federal help when disaster strikes: So far this week, Abbott has made at least two official requests to the White House for federal aid.</p>
<p>Instead, for decades, Texas has let power operators decide whether and how to prepare for extreme weather. For the most part, they do this. Texas generators focus on summer, planning for peak demand from air conditioning during 108-degree August days, which are all too common in most of the state. These companies plan for minor winter storms, too. ERCOT said last week that it was ready for this week’s storm. Of course, that turned out not to be true.</p>
<p>After the state was plunged into darkness, Abbott on Thursday asked the Legislature to mandate and find funding for the “winterization” of Texas’ power system. But beyond this step, state leaders are unlikely to fundamentally change the Texas energy grid, by subjecting it to more federal oversight or connecting it to the rest of the country. Some <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Should-Texas-join-the-national-power-grid-15961654.php" target="_blank">Texas Democrats</a> have said the state should consider joining the national grid, and there is a debate about whether it would have made a difference, considering the whole country was struggling with power problems over the course of a frigid week.</p>
<p>But it’s unthinkable to Republicans governing the state, who still sell the idea of Texas’ independence. This is the state, after all, where a Republican state lawmaker <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=HB1359" target="_blank">recently filed</a> a bill to pave the way for Texas to leave the United States—a long shot, but a powerful symbol.</p>

<p>Texas’ history as an independent country before it joined the United States in 1845 has become a part of its proud identity, says Blanton, the Texas A&amp;M historian. The reality is that Texas was “ailing” with its finances, border security and other issues before it joined the rest of the country: “It was a failing state,” he says. Still, the state’s independent streak continued to cause friction with the federal government, not just over energy policy, but also civil and voting rights legislation.</p>
<p>When I asked Abbott’s office if the governor planned to take any other action after this week, a representative pointed to statements Abbott already had made calling for ERCOT’s leadership to resign and declaring ERCOT reform an “<a href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/governor-abbott-declares-ercot-reform-an-emergency-item" target="_blank">emergency item</a>” in the current legislative session.</p>
<p>To avoid another disaster in a year or two or 10 will require something else as well from state leaders, power companies and ERCOT: a plan for climate change. Abbott’s call for winterization funding can be read as a tacit acknowledgement of climate change and the extreme weather it brings. But he and other Texas Republicans haven’t said so explicitly, and have fought efforts to curb climate change in the past.</p>
<p>“The weather is changing. Look at Harvey,” says Wood, referring to the devastating hurricane that hit the state in 2017. “These things aren’t just freakish things.”</p>
<p>John Hall, director of regulatory and legislative affairs at the Environmental Defense Fund in Texas, adds that in his eight years working with state lawmakers, almost no leaders have acknowledged the state’s infrastructure vulnerabilities against climate change. “The critical threats to human life and our quality of life require this response,” he says.</p>
<br />
<p>This week’s storm hit El Paso before it made its way through the rest of Texas. If the roads aren’t icy, it’s a solid nine-hour drive from here to Austin, and sometimes it feels like El Pasoans are utterly disconnected from whatever is happening in the rest of the state. In this case, that turned out to be a blessing: We were still moored to the rest of the country and its energy, while Texas as a whole was on its own.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, I peeked out the window to find snow gushing down into our yard. It looked like the white sky had touched down, too—we couldn’t see the Franklin Mountains or anything else in the near distance. The winter weather mesmerized my Texas-born toddlers, who loved staring out the window but couldn’t stand more than a few minutes in the cold. Later that morning, I thought we had briefly lost power when I couldn’t get our toaster oven to work. Turns out the socket just needed to be reset. When we woke up on Monday, snow was still on the ground and the weather was still below freezing, but our heater worked, our pipes hadn’t burst, and there was no need for disaster planning.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>President Joe Biden told reporters Friday that he will travel to Texas as the state remains locked in the throes of a days-long freeze that’s brought power and water systems to their knees and endangered millions. </p>
<p>“I plan on going,” the president said after delivering a virtual address to the Munich Security Conference. Biden added that he plans to visit Texas next week in order to minimize the logistical burden that accompanies any presidential visit on already strained resources in the state.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't want to be a burden,&quot; Biden said. &quot;When the president lands in a city in America, it has a long tail.&quot;</p>
<p>The president also said he would sign a major disaster declaration for Texas as early as Friday afternoon and that he spoke to Gov. Greg Abbott Thursday night about the situation in the state. Abbott had previously said he requested the declaration during his conversation with the president.</p>
<p>Biden, in a phone call with acting FEMA Administrator Bob Fenton, said he was ready to mobilize other federal agencies to address the situation in Texas, according to a White House readout of the call released later Friday. He told Fenton he would sign the major disaster declaration as soon as FEMA sent over the request.</p>
<p>Biden signed a separate emergency declaration earlier this week as the crisis was unfolding, though that one had a monetary cap on the amount of assistance the federal government can provide. Declaring a major disaster frees up the government to provide additional aid. </p>
<p>Much of Texas has been gripped by rolling blackouts and water outages as the state’s utilities were unable to accommodate the surge in demand that resulted from a devastating winter storm that brought snow and sub-freezing temperatures to a state unaccustomed to such weather.</p>
<p>A number of people have died due to hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning and other causes related to the extreme weather. </p>
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has faced a firestorm of criticism for jetting off to Mexico with his family this week while millions of Texas are in crisis, a decision which he apologized for upon cutting short his trip once it publicly surfaced.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>The brutal winter storm that turned Texas roads to ice, burst pipes across the state and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/texas-winter-storm-power-outage-ercot/" target="_blank">left millions of residents shivering</a> and without power has also damaged the reputations of three of the state’s leading Republicans.</p>
<p>Sen. Ted Cruz was discovered to have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ted-cruz-airport-power-crisis-texas" target="_blank">slipped off to Mexico</a> on Wednesday night, only to announce his return when he was caught in the act. Gov. Greg Abbott came <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/greg-abbott-winter-storm/" target="_blank">under fire over his leadership</a> and <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/editorials/article/Editorial-Governor-Abbott-s-wind-turbine-15958637.php" target="_blank">misleading claims</a> about the causes of the power outages. And former Gov. Rick Perry suggested Texans preferred power failures to federal regulation, a callous note in a moment of widespread suffering.</p>
<p>It’s more than just a public relations crisis for the three politicians. The storm has also battered the swaggering, Texas brand of free-market governance that’s central to the state’s political identity on the national stage.</p>
<p>&quot;Texans are angry and they have every right to be. Failed power, water and communications surely took some lives,” JoAnn Fleming, a Texas conservative activist and executive director of a group called Grassroots America, said in a text message exchange with POLITICO.</p>
<p>“The Texas electric grid is not secure,” said Fleming, pointing out that lawmakers “have been talking about shoring up/protecting the Texas electric grid for THREE legislative sessions (6 yrs),” but “every session special energy interests kill the bills with Republicans in charge ... Our politicians spend too much time listening to monied lobbyists &amp; political consultants. Not enough time actually listening to real people.”</p>
<p>Chad Prather, a popular Republican humorist who is running for governor against Abbott next year, echoed similar sentiments about the three politicians.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/e9/53/9e59750f4c0390ec647f76eb6fb8/gettyimages-1231190186-c.jpg" />
<br />
<p>“There’s no question that this is a case of failing to relate to the people of Texas,” said Prather, who is a host on the conservative network Blaze TV.</p>
<p>“I believe the person with the biggest consequence is going to be Greg Abbott,” Prather said. “The underlying murmur is that he, too, will make a presidential run and the governorship has become much of an afterthought. It would seem we are a little vacant at the top. At least that’s how many feel.”</p>
<p>One Texas GOP official, who did not want to be on record criticizing three of the state’s top Republicans, deadpanned that “this is not our party’s finest hour.”</p>
<p> A spokesperson for Abbott said the governor is focusing on the crisis, not politics, and is trying to find a solution.</p>
<p>Abbott has called for an investigation of the state’s main power grid,<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-power-outage-ercot/" target="_blank"> Electric Reliability Council of Texas</a>, which was once a source of laissez-faire pride because it’s heavily deregulated and separate from the federal power grid. On Thursday, Abbott called for winterizing the power grid to keep wind turbines and natural gas in pipes from freezing — an idea<a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/17/texas-power-grid-failures/" target="_blank"> recommended a decade ago</a> after the last severe winter storm, when Perry was governor.</p>
<p>Abbott’s moves follow<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-texas-gov-greg-abbott-power-outage-claims-climate-change-002303596.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIPvjCk315pBcfdjma7HSx-gfrmz1N24i2nyj110NmF_jJrMzVcAG6H8aT6-PDKXzMAW7lQ_3BKatzxZpZGCCXfw_6iDzd9qF75ahdl5F06J_d_Q6zFP40TvG9nnhqEAi5l7i8FKmQiihibhWdmEJuAX0oWPCEvs3MBZe5VFecAS" target="_blank"> widespread criticism</a> for an appearance with Fox News’ Sean Hannity in which he echoed a<a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/politifact/2021/02/18/texas-power-outages-greg-abbott-dan-crenshaw-fact-check/6791469002/" target="_blank"> misleading claim</a> attacking renewable energy as a root of the problem. Perry did the same thing in a<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Perry-says-Texans-wiling-to-suffer-blackouts-to-15956705.php" target="_blank"> blog post</a> on the website of U.S. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, but then went an extra step.</p>
<p>“Texans would be without electricity for longer than three days to keep the federal government out of their business,” Perry wrote. “Try not to let whatever the crisis of the day is take your eye off of having a resilient grid that keeps America safe personally, economically, and strategically.”</p>
<br />
<iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6233684081001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br />
<p>Unmentioned by Perry: He was governor in 2011, when experts recommended winterizing the power grid. Perry went on to run for president in 2012, then was reelected governor two years later, ran unsuccessfully for president again in 2016 and served as then-President Donald Trump’s secretary of Energy from 2017 to 2019.</p>
<p>George Seay, who served as finance chair for Perry’s 2012 presidential bid, said that he opposes the “finger-pointing” over the storm response and believes Abbott is unfairly being attacked, but that the current governor needs to take some responsibility for the situation.</p>
<p>“Leaders have to say, not only is this unacceptable, not only is it a dereliction of duty to Texas citizens and their public safety and the common good, but we have to fess up for that,” Seay said. “The governor is not a power generation expert, but he needs to raise his hand and say, ‘I’m responsible for this.’ It’s not fair to him, to be clear, but that’s the job.”</p>
<p>Seay said Cruz’s decision to slip off to Mexico — only to announce his return when word leaked out and he drew harsh criticism — won’t harm him nearly as much as his role in opposing the Electoral College certification in Congress on Jan. 6, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol. </p>
<p>“Is he focused on issues that center on the good of Texas? Not really. He’s focused on running for president in 2024 and political machinations,” Seay said. “The blame-seeking and circular firing squads we’re seeing is not helpful.”</p>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, seized the opportunity to contrast Republican leadership in Texas with President Joe Biden’s administration, which quickly offered full federal help and earlier <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/16/texas-energy-outage-469217" target="_blank">pitched plans</a> to upgrade infrastructure, counter climate change and expand the use of renewable energy.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s Abbott’s failed response or Cruz’s abandoning of our state, we shouldn’t put people in charge of government who don’t believe in government. They fail us every time,” said former federal Housing Secretary Juli&aacute;n Castro, a Democrat who’s considering a bid against Abbott or Cruz. </p>
<br />
<p>Cruz’s<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/us/politics/ted-cruz-storm-cancun.html" target="_blank"> short-circuited Cancun trip</a> made him the biggest target of all. His habit of attacking politicians for<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/18/politics/vacationing-during-crisis-ted-cruz/index.html" target="_blank"> taking time off during a disaster</a>, <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/02/17/cruz-says-he-has-no-defense-for-mocking-californias-past-power-outages-as-texas-grid-falters-amid-historic-freeze/" target="_blank">his mocking of California for its power woes</a> and his letter to <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/files/documents/Letters/Letter%20to%20Biden%20re%20Pandemic%20and%20the%20Border.pdf" target="_blank">Biden last week</a> to keep the U.S.-Mexico border as closed as possible due to Covid have all come back to haunt him.</p>
<p>Democrats sought to heighten the contrast between Cruz and his 2018 Senate opponent, former Rep. Beto O’Rourke, by pointing out that the senator went to Cancun and tweeted about the death of radio talk show host<b> </b>Rush Limbaugh while his former rival stayed in El Paso and tried to marshal his social media followers to help fellow Texans.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely important in governing and politics to be seen doing things,” said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas Republican strategist. “It’s important to be seen leading.”</p>
<p>Steinhauser said Abbott established himself as a leader in previous crises but took longer after the storm because he “had to find his footing. At first, he probably didn’t think the blackouts would last as long as they did.”</p>
<p>Chris Perkins, a Republican data analyst and pollster in the state, said there’s lots of anger and frustration to go around.</p>
<p>“There’s no playbook because the state has never seen a winter like this in its history,” Perkins said. “The cities are saying to boil the water, but there’s no water coming out of the faucet. Use gas to boil the water, but wells are freezing, so conserve gas. The state leaders are attempting to give the public the most updated information, but it’s difficult since there isn’t a historical manual on what to do.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>United Airlines is investigating who leaked data revealing when Sen. Ted Cruz originally planned to return to his frozen home state of Texas, after facing a barrage of angry constituents.</p>
<p>Cruz at first insisted on Thursday that his trip to Cancun, Mexico, in the middle of a power and water crisis in Texas, was at the behest of his daughters and skirted the issue of when he originally planned to return.</p>
<p>But earlier that day, Edward Russell, a reporter at travel news website Skift, tweeted that he had talked to a source at United who said Cruz had “rebooked his flight back to Houston from Cancun for this afternoon at around 6 a.m. today (Thursday). He was originally scheduled to return on Saturday.”</p>
<p>“It’s against United’s policies to share personal information about our customers and we are investigating this incident,” the United executive said in a statement provided exclusively to POLITICO. The executive noted that the leaker could be terminated.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of United employees have access to customer flight data to help serve customers, but leaks about individual travelers' flight plans are rare in the industry.</p>
<p>The United executive said no options are “off the table,” but it depends on the outcome of the investigation and if they definitively find the employee who disclosed the information.</p>
<p>The leak had led <a href="https://twitter.com/yashar/status/1362471198894956548" target="_blank">journalist Yashar Ali to tweet</a>: “That guy claiming to have a United source is putting that source in danger of being fired with his tweet. Airlines track every single keystroke of their agents or anyone else who has access to flight records.”</p>
<p>Details of Cruz’s original return flight from Russell was not the only piece of travel data journalists discovered about Cruz.</p>
<p>In addition, travel reporters discovered that a “CRU, R.” was on the upgrade standby list for Thursday afternoon’s flight from Cancun to Houston, three hours before Cruz issued his statement saying he was returning back to the U.S. Such upgrade lists are available publicly although they’re not widely publicized.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>As Senator Ted Cruz endured the torments of public scorn on Thursday—outed by fellow passengers on his way to a warm Cancun vacation, as millions of fellow Texans suffered from freezing temperatures and a catastrophic electricity failure—I had a sudden uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach: There but for the grace of God go I. Or at least someone I used to work for.</p>
<p>It was Sunday, February 9, 1969, and New York Mayor John Lindsay was in the middle of a tough fight for reelection. I was working as his speechwriter at the time. The Yale-educated mayor from the tony East Side had his share of political baggage already, with many Brooklyn and Queens voters convinced he was too “Manhattan-centric.” That day had a typically bleak midwinter forecast, a mix of rain and slush. Instead, New York got hammered with what became known as the Blizzard of 1969. Fifteen inches of snow pounded the city, falling with particular force in east Queens. A combination of factors—light work crews on a Sunday, budget cutbacks, snowdrifts high enough to block the plows—left neighborhoods trapped for days.</p>
<p>Lindsay was savvy enough to head to Queens in person, but unlike the heroic reception he got a year earlier, when he walked the streets of Harlem after the death of Martin Luther King, he was greeted with many colorful suggestions about where he might go and what anatomical feats he might consider. Thanks in part to the slow response to the snow, Lindsay lost the Republican primary—and although he managed to win one more term running as an independent, his political reputation never quite recovered.</p>
<p>“Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it,” Mark Twain said. Voters, though, won’t excuse politicians who throw their hands up—or, worse, turn tail when disaster strikes. Weather might be the least controllable force a politician faces, but it comes with a severe price for mishandling its consequences. And it’s not clear that Cruz, despite a quick return home, will be able to dig himself out.</p>
<p>Chicago Mayor Mike Bilandic fared even worse than Lindsay a decade later. A loyal foot soldier in the machine built by the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, he was considered a shoo-in for reelection—until a massive January storm dumped 20 inches of snow on the city, paralyzing trains, buses and traffic. With help of a powerful political ad shot as the snow was falling, insurgent candidate Jane Byrne upset Bilandic in the Democratic primary and went on to become the city’s first woman mayor.</p>
<p>These stories of winter havoc have survived to chill the hearts of politicians for decades, along with other tales of faulty, or clumsy, or disastrous responses to crises of one sort or another. Think of President George W. Bush staring out the window of Air Force One as it flew over Katrina-ravaged New Orleans, or his shout-out to the over-his-head Federal Emergency Management Agency director (“heckuva job, Brownie”). Think of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, lounging at a public beach he closed to the public in the wake of a government shutdown.</p>
<br />
<iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6233684081001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br />
<p>More recently, think of Donald Trump throwing paper towels at a hurricane-ravaged crowd in Puerto Rico, or blaming the California wildfires on inept forest management, and puzzling the president of Finland by his references to “raking.” Trump’s die-hard supporters didn’t see any of it as gaffes, but add to that his persistent minimizing of another disaster, the Covid-19 pandemic, and you have a pattern of indifference to suffering that, his pollsters say, ultimately cost him reelection.</p>
<p>In the case of Cruz, his missteps are worthy of a simulation where the player tests just how many wrong moves he can make in a row. (Leave in the midst of crisis? Check. Leave just a few months after attacking a Democratic mayor for going to Mexico during a Covid-19 lockdown? Check. Ask the overstressed Houston Police Department for assistance at the airport? Check. Claim you meant to return immediately when the airline says otherwise? Clearly, Cruz was not up to speed on how leaders best respond to a natural crisis; President Barack Obama’s response to Hurricane Sandy, his rapid marshaling of forces and his visit to the affected areas won him bipartisan praise.</p>
<p>For Cruz, are there are any lessons the senator might learn from the past? There’s one that quickly comes to mind, even though executing it may be challenging: Apologize.</p>
<p>In his reelection, Lindsay cut an ad that began: “I guessed wrong about the weather before the city’s biggest snowstorm. And that was a mistake.” It may not have been much; but voters wanted to hear this handsome Manhattan WASP scrape a little before the citizens of the outer boroughs. By contrast, Chicago Mayor Bilandic never apologized for the chaos that engulfed his city, at one point saying that a return to 70 percent efficiency was good enough. Christie was even more stubborn, noting that use of the beach was one of the perquisites of the office.</p>
<p>Cruz took the right first step—on his return to Texas Thursday afternoon, he acknowledged he’d made the wrong call: “Look, it was obviously a mistake, and in hindsight I wouldn’t have done it. … I started having second thoughts almost the moment I sat down on the plane … leaving when so many Texans were hurting didn’t feel right.”</p>
<p>The most promising course from now might be to go all-in; to apologize not just for his departure, but for his earlier ridiculing of California for its energy woes, for making a family vacation his first priority. And if he wants to change the subject, he might embrace a point that experts have long pointed to as a long-term dilemma for politicians when it comes to disasters: That while voters are acutely aware of immediate responses to a crisis, they never reward leaders who try to prevent the next one.</p>
<p>University of Pennsylvania professor Dan Hopkins has pointed out that disaster preparedness is extremely cost-effective policy that just doesn’t register with the electorate the way failure does. “As voters, we pay attention in the wake of disasters, and we reward or punish incumbents based on their actions,” he wrote. “But when the cameras are elsewhere, we’re not nearly as good about rewarding the incumbents who are getting ready for the next disaster.”</p>
<p>Taking that path would require from Ted Cruz a strong dose of humility, and a willingness to step away from scoring cheap political points in favor of an approach that might actually make things better. A glance of the senator’s record tells us just how likely that response will be.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said for years that governments should set rules for the internet. Now his Washington critics say the company’s news blackout in Australia proves he didn’t mean it.</p>
<p>The company blocked all news content for users in Australia this week in the face of a proposed law that would force it to pay news publishers for displaying their content. The move provided instant fodder for those in the U.S. who say Facebook is too big, too powerful and verging on ungovernable — the very concerns that prompted federal and state regulators to launch an antitrust suit against the company late last year.</p>
<p>Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) called the move “an unacceptable bullying tactic that only underscores concerns with their market dominance.” Warner has called for Facebook to take more responsibility for posts and ads on its 2.7-billion-member platform.</p>
<p>“It’s worrisome that large tech companies — which routinely tell policymakers they acknowledge the need for regulation — continually resort to using their large scale and dominance to undermine democratically adopted laws,” Warner said in a statement.</p>
<p>That kind of reaction could be particularly damaging for Facebook as it faces increasing scrutiny from lawmakers over both antitrust allegations and how it handles user content. On Thursday, the House antitrust subcommittee announced the latest step in its long-running investigations into the tech industry — a series of hearings to consider new antitrust laws. That same day, the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it is pulling in Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to testify next month about misinformation on their platforms.</p>
<p>“That the whims of Mark Zuckerberg are so consequential for an entire country helps underscore the stakes in taking on Facebook and Google, while that is still possible,” said Jeff Hauser, director of the advocacy group Revolving Door Project, which has been critical of Facebook’s political power.</p>
<p>He argued that Australia’s move could provide momentum to the U.S. effort against the company.</p>
<p>“If a country with a population less than one tenth of ours can fight back against Facebook, why can't the USA?” Hauser asked.</p>
<p>The Australian law would require online platforms to pay fees to news publishers whenever their content appears on the tech companies’ sites, either shared by users or by the news organizations themselves. The prices would be set either by negotiations between the companies or through an arbitration body.</p>
<p>Google, the other tech behemoth facing an ongoing federal antitrust suit in the U.S., took a different approach to the Australian development. It signed a global agreement this week to pay News Corp. an undisclosed amount for its content <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210217005588/en/" target="_blank">it will showcase in a new specialty news product</a>. The company said it has also signed partnerships with more than 500 news organizations globally and is in talks with others.</p>
<p>In response to Facebook’s Australia decision, House antitrust subcommittee Chair David Cicilline (D-R.I.) tweeted: “Facebook is not compatible with democracy. Threatening to bring an entire country to its knees to agree to Facebook’s terms is the ultimate admission of monopoly power.”</p>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.</p>
<p>While Zuckerberg <a href="https://docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ByEvent.aspx?EventID=110883" target="_blank"><u>has repeatedly called for</u></a> “a more active role for governments and regulators and updated rules for the internet” — a message it spreads in an endless roster of online ads and sponsored content — Facebook argues that the Australia case is unique.</p>
<p>“The proposed law fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between our platform and publishers who use it to share news content,” Will Easton, Facebook’s managing director for Australia and New Zealand, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/" target="_blank"><u>wrote in a company blog post</u></a>. Easton argued that publishers eagerly opt to share their journalism on Facebook to make use of the platform’s enormous reach around the world.</p>
<p>Not even all Facebook’s Washington critics are convinced that Australia’s elected leaders are in the right, or that the law’s proponents are all engaged in a noble quest.</p>
<p>“I don’t necessarily think the Australian approach is the best route,” Warner said. Many observers say the law would mainly benefit News Corp., the Rupert Murdoch-founded behemoth, which has long been on what its CEO, Robert Thomson, has called a “quixotic quest” to bring Facebook and Google to heel.</p>
<p>Critics of the Australian law say paying for links violates one of the building blocks of the internet. Mike Masnick, editor of the widely read site TechDirt, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210217/22383446265/bizarre-reaction-to-facebooks-decision-to-get-out-news-business-australia.shtml" target="_blank"><u>said Australia’s proposal</u></a> “should concern basically anyone who supports a free and open internet.”</p>
<p>As for Facebook’s support for government oversight, the company has largely limited its calls for more regulation to four discrete areas that it calls harmful content, election integrity, privacy and data portability — none of which are at issue in Australia.</p>
<p>Still, people pressing for more checks on Facebook say the real worry is what looks like an attempt by the $700-billion company to force a government’s hand.</p>
<p>Canadian minister Steven Guilbeault, whose portfolio includes tech, said Thursday that the company’s handling of the Australian situation was <u>“highly irresponsible.”</u> Guilbeault added that legislation addressing what he called “fair compensation” for news organizations, drawing in part on the Australian bill proposal, will soon be introduced in that country.</p>
<p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed the concerns about Facebook’s power play, saying during remarks Friday at the Munich Security Conference that decisions “that have huge impacts on our democracies” shouldn’t be left up to “computer programs without any human supervision or to boardrooms in Silicon Valley.” She added, “The latest decision by Facebook regarding Australia is just another proof for that.”</p>
<p>Back in the U.S., Judd Legum, another frequent Facebook critic and author of the newsletter Popular Information, argued that the company is employing a clear pressure tactic by pulling news in Australia even before the bill has passed.</p>
<p>His take: “It’s an attempt to bully the Australian government into not passing the law.”</p>

<br /> 
<p>President Joe Biden delivered an emphatic message to democratic allies and rivals alike at the Munich Security Conference Friday morning, pledging to work with Europe and stop at nothing to ensure democratic values prevail around the world.</p> 
<p>“I believe with every ounce of my being that democracy must prevail,” Biden said.</p> 
<p>Appearing on-screen in a display of trans-Atlantic unity with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron, Biden said democracy is under assault around the world and called on Western allies to “demonstrate that democracy functions and works and together there’s nothing we can’t do.”</p> 
<p>Aware that <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-nato/" target="_blank">many European countries came to doubt America’s commitment to collective NATO defense</a> under former President Donald Trump, Biden insisted: “Let me erase any lingering doubt: The United States will work closely with our European Union partners and capitals across the continent.”</p>
<p>The president added that America’s commitment to NATO is “guaranteed” and that “an attack on one is an attack on all,” a sharp break from Trump, whose <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2018/07/12/trump-nato-spending-714976" target="_blank">rhetoric on the trans-Atlantic alliance</a> was dominated by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-nato/" target="_blank">haranguing member states about their relatively low levels of defense spending</a>.</p> 
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/98/c9/ab01134d4b758e89ef6a84ef9fb6/gettyimages-1231258910-1.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Biden reserved his toughest words for China and Russia.</p> 
<p>Biden accused Beijing of perpetuating abuses that “undercut the foundations of the international economic system,” and insisted that “Chinese companies should be held to the same standards” of governance and transparency as Western companies.</p> 
<p>Urging a strong NATO and EU, Biden insisted that only trans-Atlantic unity could contain Russia. </p> 
<p>“It’s so much easier for the Kremlin to bully and threaten individual states than a strong and united trans-Atlantic community,” Biden said.</p> 
<p>Speaking after Biden, Angela Merkel said that “the prospects of democracy are better “thanks to Biden’s trans-Atlantic commitments and promised her full support — with a subtle warning: “In Germany we say words are not enough, you have to do them, and that is true in trans-Atlantic cooperation.” Merkel said that Germany and U.S. interests would &quot;not always converge” but that trans-Atlantic values are fundamentally the same.</p> 
<br />
<p>Emmanuel Macron offered assurances that the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-trade-wants-strategic-autonomy-decide-what-means/" target="_blank">EU’s push for “strategic autonomy”</a> is not an effort to distance itself from the U.S., but to show that Europe can be a “reliable and responsible and credible partner,” instead of a continent dependent on the U.S. for security. </p> 
<p>Macron called for western allies to immediately deliver 13 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to African nations to protect the continent’s health workers, before China and Russia fill the void.</p>
<p>At an earlier meeting of G-7 leaders, Biden agreed with counterparts “to work together to beat Covid-19 and build back better,” mirroring his own domestic messaging. On economic issues, the G-7 committed to “cut emissions and create good jobs on a path to net zero no later than 2050,” to reform the World Trade Organization, and to agree a global taxation framework by mid-2021.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>President Joe Biden and his team are fanning out across the West’s leading institutions and forums to announce that “America is back.” </p>
<p>They’re set to be greeted with welcome relief by allies, who — in the face of a global recession and pandemic, not to mention PTSD from the Trump years — appear happy for now to table complicated negotiations over shared challenges and thorny points of divergence.</p>
<p>“These next four days will set the tone” for the following four years, said Alexander Stubb, who spent nearly a decade dealing with then-Vice President Biden, including a stint as Finland’s prime minister.</p>
<p>Biden is guaranteed to get hearty applause while addressing G-7 leaders and the Munich Security Conference on Friday, but his administration should expect a rockier road ahead. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/18/biden-iran-nuclear-deal-470000" target="_blank">After conversations with his British, French and German counterparts</a>, aimed at <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/us-uk-europe-allies-reaffirm-iran-nuclear-deal-stance-paris/" target="_blank">reviving the Iran nuclear deal</a>, Secretary of State Antony Blinken is meeting Quad counterparts (India, Japan and Australia) on Friday and the EU’s foreign affairs council Monday. His audience is expecting him to play transatlantic bad cop, compared to the ever-optimistic Biden.</p>
<p>On other fronts in the charm offensive, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has wrapped up two days of meetings with NATO colleagues, where <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-jens-stoltenberg-delays-decision-afghanistan-withdrawal/" target="_blank">he successfully argued to delay NATO troop withdrawal from Afghanistan</a>, while climate envoy John Kerry today joins U.N. Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres to sweep the U.S. back into the Paris Climate Agreement. </p>
<p>POLITICO spoke to a dozen European and Japanese leaders and senior officials who often lived in fear of former President Donald Trump's tweets. While they’re positively relaxed about the speeches Biden will deliver Friday, they know Biden’s powers are limited. </p>
<p>European leaders in particular worry that Trumpism remains alive, are skeptical about the results the White House can squeeze from a deeply divided U.S. Congress and aren’t yet sold on meeting the Biden administration’s expectations on China, Russia and trade.</p>
<br />
<iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6233745762001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br />
<p>To maximize the chances of a functioning G-7 and rekindled transatlantic relationship, allies are setting the bar low for Friday’s gatherings. </p>
<p>As president and host of Friday’s G-7 gathering, the U.K. is giving Biden a passing grade before he opens his mouth. “Biden doesn’t need to come to this meeting with a suite of creative policy announcements for it to be important or successful,” said a senior British diplomat, adding “it’s enough to stop America’s image bleeding. I doubt anyone will be disappointed.” </p>
<p>A Japanese government spokesperson stressed the need for G-7 countries “to lead the post-COVID international order,” and anticipated full-throated agreement with the shared democratic values Biden is expected to advocate. </p>
<p>Even the Hungarian government — which had an antagonistic relationship with the Obama administration — couldn’t bring itself to sound any alarm bells about the Biden era: Zolt&aacute;n Kov&aacute;cs, a cabinet member and government spokesperson, said he had no concerns or expectations to convey to Biden.</p>
<p>While boilerplate commitments to multilateralism and democracy are already flowing, they disguise bubbling transatlantic tensions on issues from trade to energy policy to China.</p>
<p>European officials know the tough conversations can’t be avoided for long. Biden “said all the right things” to reassure Europe after “the unpredictable cacophony of Trump,” said Stubb.</p>
<p>“But the realistic picture is that the world is radically different from 2016 when Trump entered the scene,&quot; he added. &quot;This is the message Blinken should deliver” when he meets with the EU’s 27 foreign ministers and the bloc’s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Europe isn't afraid to go its own way</h3>
<p>Shocked by Britain’s vote to leave, and wedged between an aggressive Russia, a rising China and a disinterested America under Trump, the EU set a course for “strategic autonomy” in recent years. In that time, China also <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/china-topples-us-as-eus-top-trade-partner-over-2020/" target="_blank">overtook the U.S.</a> as the EU's biggest trading partner. </p>
<p>The EU’s repositioning is only now bearing fruit, but that's not to say it's superficial either: There's a determined independent approach to China and Russia relations, a beefed-up industrial policy, tough digital regulations and taxes, and only a tentative commitment to EU joint defense and increased national defense spending. </p>
<p>While the Biden administration sees the EU as an essential pillar of stability in global affairs, it recoils at many of these decisions. </p>
<p>Europeans also worry that in four years, a new Republican administration may junk Biden’s defense and climate commitments, leaving them stranded with long-term investments and no American backup. “Who’s to say we won’t end up right where we were four years from now?” one senior German defense official asked. </p>
<p>National leaders and climate officials welcome U.S. re-entry into the Paris Climate Agreement — Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, called it “an encouraging step” — but said they will celebrate only when Congress passes a strict and well-funded 2030 emissions reduction target. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Trade tensions are simmering</h3>
<p>On trade, there is goodwill but that isn’t stopping points of contention spilling out into the open. </p>
<p>Kurz, Austria’s 34-year-old chancellor, told POLITICO that once progress is made against Covid-19 and toward economic recovery, “we should give our trade relations a fresh start by settling ongoing trade disputes and ending punitive measures as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Kurz is referring to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-winegrowers-hope-biden-can-lift-them-out-of-the-red/" target="_blank">Trump-era tariffs the new administration is yet to unwind</a>, and Biden’s new &quot;Made in America&quot; government procurement policy, which is provoking grumbling in Brussels. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU’s trade chief, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/joe-biden-valdis-dombrovskis-eu-trade-chief-warns-over-buy-american-push/" target="_blank">told reporters Thursday</a>: &quot;We will be assessing to which extent the U.S. complies with its [World Trade Organization] commitments under the global procurement agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>As part of a broader review of trade policy, Dombrovskis promised the EU will be “tougher and more assertive.” That includes a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12803-Instrument-to-deter-and-counteract-coercive-actions-by-third-countries-" target="_blank">European Commission effort to deliver an “anti-coercion” trade instrument</a>, which would allow it to retaliate against any future U.S. efforts to block EU trade. EU officials are frustrated that European companies such as Airbus and Renault have lost out because of American sanctions against Iran. Brussels is also worried that Washington may outlaw EU companies from shipping goods (like cars) made with U.S. microchips to China, on national security grounds. </p>
<p>“In the years to come, we will witness a certain amount of tension in the field of semiconductors,” said <a href="https://politico.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e26c1a1c392386a968d02fdbc&amp;id=f4721cda33&amp;e=6963b455ff" target="_blank">Thierry Breton</a>, the EU’s internal market commissioner. “We, in Europe, intend to play our full part in this new geostrategic game of chess.”</p>
<p>Back in Washington, administration officials are mostly biting their tongues, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/clouds-gather-over-nord-stream-2/" target="_blank">avoiding wading into controversial geopolitics like the Nordstream II gas pipeline from Russia to Germany</a>, though House Republicans are urging the imposition of sanctions. </p>
<p>On Trump’s favorite topic of defense funding commitments, Austin, the defense secretary, wrote Wednesday that the U.S. is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/lloyd-austin-nato-biden-administration/2021/02/16/813113d6-7083-11eb-b8a9-b9467510f0fe_story.html" target="_blank">“ready to consult together, decide together and act together,”</a> with NATO allies, a markedly softer tone than Trump. </p>
<p>European leaders know this harmony won’t last without extra effort from Europe. “Both President Biden and Secretary Blinken know Europe very well. But this also means they know Europe could be a better partner and ally,” Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told POLITICO. </p>
<p>“We need to put our European house in order by being united on foreign policy and defense,” de Croo added.</p>
<p>Washington’s frustrations are almost certain to burst out into the open around the EU’s push for “strategic autonomy” from the U.S., China and Russia. </p>
<p>While American officials roll their eyes at the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/borrell-stands-by-as-lavrov-calls-eu-unreliable-partner/" target="_blank">EU’s bungling of Russia relations</a>, and see the bloc’s “<a href="https://politico.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e26c1a1c392386a968d02fdbc&amp;id=071d64e52c&amp;e=6963b455ff" target="_blank">tech sovereignty</a>” push as blatant protectionism, top of their complaint list is a recent EU-China investment deal that Angela Merkel and EU officials deliberately pushed through in the last weeks of the Trump administration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">The China problem</h3>
<p>“China will be the elephant in the room,” said Stubb, but others including Austria’s Kurz are happy to bring the discussion into the spotlight. “Austria is also ready to engage in an open dialogue with the United States on China,” Kurz said. </p>
<p>The problem for the U.S. may be a lack of EU unity on the topic. “If Mr. Biden is stretching out his hand towards Europe, he expects a firm shake, not 27 opinions from as many member states,&quot; said De Croo.</p>
<p>Many smaller European countries feel stuck on China: They distrust how Beijing wields power, but find it both too big to ignore and too big to handle alone. Germany and France — the biggest EU powers — have been vocal about their preference to engage with China rather than forming a Cold War-style bloc against it. </p>
<p>While the EU shifted closer toward U.S. positions on China in 2020, the lack of unity leaves many European countries still allowing Huawei in at least parts of their mobile networks, and prevents the EU from imposing sanctions on China over <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-china-inestment-agreement-soft-approach-odds-us/" target="_blank">human rights abuses</a> against the Uighur Muslim minority.</p>
<p>Last week, as China attempted to use a special summit to strengthen relations with Central and Eastern European countries, half of the 12 invited EU national leaders <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/china-xi-jinping-eastern-europe-trade-agriculture-strategy-gets-the-cold-shoulder/" target="_blank">failed to show up</a> to pay homage to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who hosted the event. </p>
<p>When Blinken meets with 27 European foreign ministers Monday via videoconference, he will begin testing the waters on whether the EU can be a strong U.S. ally on China policy. </p>
<p>Aware that pressure from D.C. is on the way, Brussels is considering blocking products made with slave labor before they enter the EU market as part of its new trade strategy, Dombrovskis, the EU’s trade chief, said. Countries including the U.S., Canada and the U.K. have taken steps to avoid importing such products, following increasingly detailed reports on forced labor in China’s Xinjiang region.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NATO — which includes 21 EU countries as members — has quietly expanded its remit to China: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said the alliance’s strategy must be based on defending democracy against China's and Russia’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/european-allies-set-to-offer-biden-vows-of-allegiance-and-money?cmpid=BBD021621_BRUS&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=210216&amp;utm_campaign=brussels" target="_blank">“authoritarian pushback against rules-based international order.”</a> </p>
<p>NATO’s traditional foe is another source of EU division and potential conflict with a Biden administration. To the annoyance of Baltic countries, Emmanuel Macron has spent his French presidency attempting to succeed where Merkel, Barack Obama and others have failed — by turning Vladimir Putin into a security partner for Europe. There’s no evidence it’s working. </p>
<p>Italy’s new prime minister, Mario Draghi, seems determined to follow in Macron’s footsteps: using his debut speech Wednesday to say Italy would try to increase dialogue with Russia, while expressing concerns over violations of fundamental rights in the country.</p>
<p>Draghi’s remarks come as <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ministers-expected-to-prepare-new-sanctions-on-russia/" target="_blank">the EU is considering whether to hit Russia with further sanctions</a>. The topic will be on the table of the bloc’s foreign affairs ministers’ meeting Monday, right after Blinken finishes his discussion with ministers. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">We’ll always have Munich</h3>
<p>President Biden is returning to familiar ground at the Munich Security Conference, with a familiar message for familiar faces: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab470h3X8I8" target="_blank">Without a stable Atlantic alliance everything, in my view, falls apart</a>.” But what worked in 2009 and 2019 may not be enough in 2021 as democracy finds itself under attack from all quarters, including at home in the United States. </p>
<p>Biden has had to adjust his domestic message and policies to fit with the times, and deliver a flurry of concrete actions to repair the damage he discovered when assuming office. Sooner or later, he’ll need to do the same abroad. </p>

<br />
<p>The U.S. got cheers as it rejoined the Paris Agreement Friday, a long-expected move under President Joe Biden that the administration nonetheless packed with all the pomp and circumstance the Zoom-era can muster.</p>
<p>But after the (virtual) confetti falls, the real work begins — and the world has few clear answers for tackling runaway climate change, much as when nations banded together to sign Paris in 2015.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic brought a<b> </b>brief respite on the carbon front last year, as the global shutdown in transportation and other economic activity resulted in a significant but temporary decline in greenhouse gas output — perhaps even a slowdown in future growth.<b> </b>But the world is still on track to exceed the temperature threshold that scientists warn would cement the most disastrous consequences effects of climate change. And the U.S. under former President Donald Trump backslid in terms of international climate leadership, essentially standing still on carbon emissions when the world drastically needed to ramp up its climate-fighting efforts.</p>
<p>Friday's ceremony reverses Trump's most symbolic climate action, which made the U.S. the only country in the world to pull itself out of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Biden's supporters hope the return to the Paris pact is still enough to help restore the United States' leadership role, even as he takes on the domestic economic transformation and diplomatic fights that climate progress will require.</p>
<p>&quot;The massive crater of credibility we find ourselves in as a starting point is an opportunity, too,” said Paul Bodnar, who worked on climate issues in Barack Obama’s White House and State Department, noting that nobody else picked up the mantel of global climate leader during the Trump years. &quot;It’s not like some other force yanked the world into some era of climate action. So we have the opportunity to be the ones to do it.”</p>
<p>The main message Friday from Biden, his climate envoy John Kerry and others on his team, was that the U.S. is back.</p>
<p>“Climate change and science diplomacy can never again be 'add-ons' in our foreign policy discussions,&quot; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. &quot;Addressing the real threats from climate change and listening to our scientists is at the center of our domestic and foreign policy priorities. It is vital in our discussions of national security, migration, international health efforts, and in our economic diplomacy and trade talks.”</p>
<p>Here's where the fight becomes more difficult, however:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Dealing with China</h3>
<p>China, the world’s top producer of carbon pollution, looms large in any climate discussion because of its vague pledges to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2060. Skeptics suspect that Beijing's notoriously secretive government is juicing its climate stats, and China also hasn't spelled out whether its vow extends to the emissions it spurs beyond its borders, where China finances the bulk of the world’s overseas coal power plants.</p>
<p>That uncertainty creates domestic difficulties for Biden, offering his critics an opening to accuse the administration of failing to force China to do its fair share on climate change.</p>
<p>The relationship between the U.S. and China has also soured since the two helped deliver momentum for the Paris Agreement with a bilateral emissions deal, ramping up pressure for the Biden administration to confront Beijing on issues like human rights, trade, intellectual property theft and spying. While both the U.S. and China have identified climate change as an area of mutual cooperation, untangling climate from those other issues will be tricky — and Beijing has signaled it sees all those tensions as connected.</p>
<p>“Does any of this seem easy? No,” said Sam Ricketts, co-founder of environmental group Evergreen Action. “These things all do become intertwined in negotiations on trade and diplomacy.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Resolving blue-green tensions</h3>
<p>Biden has touted his blue collar roots and career-long support from organized labor. But he’s also made big promises to environmental backers he courted on the campaign trail to move away from coal, oil and gas. Finding a way to please both constituencies will present challenges.</p>
<p>Tempers already have flared over Biden nixing the Keystone XL pipeline and halting federal oil and gas leasing. Longer-term issues like the shift to electric vehicles, which require fewer parts, could spell trouble with auto worker unions.</p>
<p>And while renewable energy jobs are growing, unionization rates in the sector are poor compared with counterparts<b> </b>who work in pipelines, electric utilities and fossil fuels. And those green economy jobs aren’t just going to seamlessly materialize in communities where people have long relied on fossil fuel industry work, either.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not going to ask people to go from the middle of Ohio or Pennsylvania to ship out to the coast to have solar jobs,” White House domestic policy chief Gina McCarthy said on Jan. 27 as Biden laid out a sweeping climate change executive order.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">The U.S. has its own petrostates</h3>
<p>The U.S. has shaped itself into the world’s top fossil fuel producer<b> </b>— a shift that began under George W. Bush and accelerated during the Obama era. Even amid its climate vows, the United States aims to ship its petroleum and liquefied natural gas all over the world on the grounds of promoting economic activity, energy security for allies and providing lower-carbon sources for energy-poor nations considering coal.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement also contains a significant loophole: Nations only count the emissions from where fuels are burned, not when they’re produced. So if the U.S. exports a gusher of oil, gas and coal abroad, none of that counts on paper against the nation's climate goals. While those are the rules of the system, environmental activists say it brings into question how the U.S. can pledge to raise its own climate ambitions while profiting off planet-heating fuels.</p>
<p>“You need to respond not only to the economic and political realities but to the needs and interests of everyone around the world — to the political and scientific necessities of the world,” said Shuo Peskoe-Yang, a climate activist who has worked with environmental groups Climate Mobilization and Corporate Accountability.</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear where the Biden administration will draw the line on things like fossil fuel exports. Energy Secretary nominee Jennifer Granholm, for example, has said the U.S. should continue to allow exports of liquefied natural gas to countries if that fuel replaces dirtier forms of energy, like coal. Biden also remains opposed to Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline across Europe, which would supply natural gas for the continent while pumping money into the Kremlin.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">'Made in America' tensions</h3>
<p>Biden’s emphasis on promoting U.S.-made products could well slow his plans for trillions of dollars in climate-friendly infrastructure. Much of the renewable energy kit,<b> </b>such as solar panels and offshore wind turbines,<b> </b>is produced abroad. That’s especially true for solar, as solar cell and panel-makers were subjected to tariffs under Trump.</p>
<p>The electric batteries Biden hopes will power American cars and buses in the coming years are also largely made outside the U.S. The U.S. International Trade Commission on Feb. 10 blocked imports from a South Korean battery-maker that’s a major supplier for Ford and Volkswagen over trade secrets concerns.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>President Joe Biden’s presidency hinges in large part on his success in handling the pandemic. But nearly a month into power, he’s beginning to discover just how much of that task is out of his control.</p>
<p>The White House is locked in a delicate dance with governors over reopening schools, distributing Covid shots and enforcing mask mandates, with Biden’s team wary of alienating key state leaders even as it takes stock of the lurching response to the crisis. Governors, in turn, are starting to push back on<b> </b>the first federal efforts to pressure them.</p>
<p>The administration has poured energy into courting both Democrats and Republicans, pitching itself as an equal partner and eager collaborator. It’s a sharp contrast from the Trump era, when most decisions were thrown to the states. And it’s a decent bet that, facing a fatigued public and teetering economy, even the most skeptical governors need Biden just as much as he needs them.</p>
<p>“This whole time, governors have felt like they’re the ones under the gun,” said one adviser to several governors. “They understand the way this has been set up, people are inclined to blame them if things don’t go well.”</p>
<p>Yet the federal government’s charm offensive threatens to bog down Biden’s early efforts to rein in the virus and claim political credit for restoring a sense of normalcy.</p>
<p>The White House has resisted ordering states to let teachers jump the vaccine line, even as it struggles to convince educators to return to school. Biden officials have also held off on criticizing certain governors for easing mask mandates and restrictions on indoor gathering, despite fears that emerging, more contagious Covid-19 variants could fuel a new surge.</p>
<p>And when it comes to shipping out vaccines, the administration is trying to balance efforts to reach nursing homes and communities of color with governors’ complaints that they’re quickly running through their weekly allocations of shots.</p>
<p>&quot;Our strong partnership with states over the last several weeks is helping us vaccinate more people,&quot; a White House spokesperson said, adding that the administration is in constant contact with governors.</p>
<br />
<p>Nine governors warned Biden on Monday that federal plans to divert portions of the vaccine supply directly to community health centers and retail pharmacies risked creating further confusion over the inoculation effort — while also setting up state leaders for any public blowback. They pressed the Centers for Disease Control to change the way it displays vaccine data on its public facing dashboard, so it doesn’t appear states are doing a poor job of administering doses that they have no control over.</p>
<p>“Due to the anxiety created by the demand and supply of the vaccine, it is imperative that the American people fully understand the process,” the governors, led by Arkansas Republican Asa Hutchinson and New York Democrat Andrew Cuomo, wrote. “States also need visibility into the federal vaccination efforts at the facility level happening in our borders.”</p>
<p>Cuomo on a private call the next day appealed<b> </b>directly to top White House officials, telling them that states need to know “what’s going where, who controls what and who doesn’t control what,” according to notes of the call obtained by POLITICO.</p>
<p>White House Covid coordinator Jeff Zients acknowledged the complaints and vowed to have health officials weigh the feedback, even as he touted the benefits of the new distribution channels — the kind of diplomatic approach that’s won Zients high marks with governors in his first weeks.</p>
<p>The exchange was further evidence of the shifting relationship as well between the White House and state leaders since Biden took office, with governors emboldened once again to offer frank feedback without worrying they’d be frozen out of the West Wing.</p>
<p>“One change for sure is that people feel free to express their points of view regardless,” said the adviser to several governors, alluding to GOP governors fear of antagonizing former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>But it’s also an acknowledgment that the White House has little direct control over how vaccines are distributed or when schools reopen, even as they’ve become vital criteria with which to measure Biden’s first year.</p>
<br />
<p>States are responsible for distributing and administering the vast majority of vaccine doses each week. Resuming in-class learning has devolved into a district-by-district negotiation across swaths of the country, putting Biden’s pledge to reopen the majority of K-8 schools by April 30 into the hands of governors, mayors and superintendents.</p>
<p>And while the White House has sought to draw a sharp distinction between its wide-ranging efforts to end the pandemic and the prior administration’s rocky response, Biden aides have privately fretted over the political danger of failing to meet their own self-imposed deadlines.</p>
<p>“We have to get the pandemic under control and get the economy moving again,” a White House official said.</p>
<p>The Biden administration in recent weeks has pressed its case in private meetings and phone calls,<b> </b>hoping to win over state officials while avoiding the potential for public blowups that could derail its ambitions and further politicize the Covid response.</p>
<p>“The CDC made it clear that essential workers — educators — should be prioritized,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a close Biden ally on reopenings. “It’s the states that are now in charge of making these decisions.”</p>
<p>During one meeting with governors and mayors of both parties last week, Biden stressed the toll that school closures have taken on families — particularly working mothers who have had to balance their jobs and childcare. He’s also dispatched officials from the Department of Education and CDC to enlist<b> </b>national, state and local groups — from school system leaders down to individual school boards, counselors, psychologists and social workers — to participate in reopening conversations.</p>
<p>Dating back to the transition, the White House kept in frequent contact with New York public schools in particular, which in September became the first large school district in the country to open its doors.</p>
<br />
<p>“He’s taking this very forward-leaning position, knowing full well that he does not control the levers,” said a high-ranking state Democrat in touch with the administration on the schools issue.</p>
<p>The White House has separately instituted a series of weekly calls with state officials to troubleshoot pandemic response problems and push its initiatives, including a Tuesday all-governors session and a separate set of meetings with states grouped by region, according to multiple sources.</p>
<p>Those regional calls<b> </b>pull in<b> </b>officials from across the government to work through state-specific issues like vaccine supply and medical staffing. Zients and Andy Slavitt, a senior adviser for the response, often serve as primary points of contact for individual state leaders, in addition to members of the White House’s intergovernmental affairs office.</p>
<p>Taken together, officials from one state told POLITICO they were in touch with the administration on Covid or school reopenings at least once a day.</p>
<p>“It’s not a very top-down structure anymore,” said George Helmy, chief of staff to New Jersey<b> </b>Democratic<b> </b>Gov. Phil Murphy, who stood out among Democrats for his comparatively strong relationship with Trump. “They understand that we’re the ones on the ground who are best able to tell them what our implementation challenges are.”</p>
<p>Still, the White House has taken longer<b> </b>than expected<b> </b>to line up its public messaging — leaving it on the defensive as Republicans step up their attacks over the failure to reopen schools and frustrating some allies who warn that Biden will soon need to take a stronger stand.</p>
<p>One senior Democratic official close to the discussions between the White House and the states said the administration was taken aback by the initial pushback on reopening from some districts. But that should serve as a wakeup call, the official said, that Biden will need to be more forceful — even at the risk of rankling some governors.</p>
<p>“There are policy choices you have to make here, and if one is ‘we want schools open,’ then go and vaccinate teachers,” the official said. “There’s no winning on these things. You have to make a decision and then you have to move forward.”</p>

<br />
<p>When Joe Biden met with a group of mayors and governors last week he bluntly told them to get ready for a legislative defeat: his proposed minimum wage hike was unlikely to happen, he said, at least in the near term.</p>
<p>“I really want this in there but it just doesn't look like we can do it because of reconciliation,” Biden told the group, according to a person in the room. “I’m not going to give up. But right now, we have to prepare for this not making it.”</p>
<p>The comments, which were confirmed by two other people familiar with the conversation, were the furthest Biden has gone in conceding the coming axing of the $15-an-hour minimum wage provision from his first major legislative package. And they suggest that the president is more inclined to manage the fallout of it not being included than to pursue long-shot, political-capital consuming efforts to fight for its insertion.</p>
<p>Sitting in the Oval Office with Republican and Democratic elected officials last Friday to advocate for his $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, he didn’t hide his skepticism.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t look like we can do it,” he said of the minimum wage hike.</p>
<p>For weeks now, the White House has been trying to manage expectations on the feasibility of advancing a $15-an-hour minimum wage provision through a broader “rescue” package. Biden first suggested it might not make it into the final Covid relief bill in an interview with CBS prior to the Super Bowl, noting his belief that the Senate parliamentarian would determine it did not jibe with budgetary rules that allow a bill to pass with just 51 votes in the Senate.</p>
<br />
<p>His comments <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/11/biden-minimum-wage-increase-468565" target="_blank"><u>drew pushback</u></a> from fellow Democrats,<b> </b>who have argued that raising the minimum wage isn’t just necessary for an economically-battered country but is sound politics as well. They have urged the White House to find avenues for making it reconciliation-compliant, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/12/kyrsten-sinema-democrats-468768" target="_blank"><u>to push party members skeptical</u></a> of a major minimum wage hike to get on board and to consider the procedural nuclear option of having the party—with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote—overrule the parliamentarian.</p>
<p>“Given the makeup of the Senate, this is our best opportunity and the right moment in the midst of this pandemic, to give millions of workers a long overdue raise,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the progressive caucus chair, said on a press call with reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Biden’s suggestion to mayors and governors, that they start preparing for the absence of a minimum wage hike in the Covid bill, suggests what has been hinted at elsewhere: He is reluctant to deploy such strong-arm options.</p>
<p>“President Biden has been consistent in private and public about his commitment to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which is why he included it in his first major piece of legislation,” said White House spokesperson Mike Gwin. “That commitment will remain unshaken whether or not this can be done through reconciliation.”</p>
<p>The meeting with state and local leaders included a wide-ranging conversation with Biden, touching on everything from municipal assistance to the importance of reopening schools, with<b> </b>Biden sharing concerns about how shuttered classrooms are impacting working mothers. But some in the room made a point of pushing back on his proposal to include the higher, $15 minimum wage in the $1.9 trillion relief package.</p>
<p>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, one of four Republicans at the meeting, stressed to Biden and the group that he didn’t think raising the wage was directly related to the immediate problems caused by the pandemic, according to two of the sources. Biden didn’t push back on Hogan’s point at the time. Nor was there a protracted discussion on the minimum wage. The conversation simply moved on.</p>
<p>Hogan also urged Biden to help ensure that the package was as bipartisan as he could, a point another official in the room said the president appeared receptive to.</p>
<p>“I really need your help on this,” Biden told the group. “It needs to be bipartisan.”</p>
<p>Democratic attendees at the meeting included New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, New Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. The Republicans were Hogan, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, Arlington, Tex. Mayor Jeff Williams and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson.</p>

<br />
<p>Democratic leaders are racing to get President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion pandemic aid plan through Congress, fulfilling one of his biggest early promises. But even if they hit their ambitious targets, major parts of the bill may already be too slow for many Americans walloped by the virus.</p>
<p>That’s because some of the largest pieces of the aid will not hit U.S. households for at least another month — and in some cases longer — given the host of new bureaucratic holdups that are bound to follow congressional action. The lag is expected to be most painful for the millions of jobless Americans facing a drop-off in their $300 a week boost in unemployment payments, even if Congress can stay on track and get its Covid aid measure to Biden’s desk by mid-March.</p>
<p>Delays in the delivery of federal economic aid are a Washington fixture, but their effect on Biden's plan comes with particularly high stakes. The new president is devoting significant political capital to promoting the package as he tries to heal widespread anguish among Americans after nearly a year of pandemic disruption, making every day count as his White House pushes for benefits to get approved and distributed.</p>
<p>Democrats are aware that their current plans to push the bill through at what qualifies as top speed for Congress may not be enough to assuage anxious voters.</p>
<p>Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said constituents have been approaching him at the grocery store, complaining about the disconnect between congressional action and unemployment aid making it to their accounts because state unemployment offices are swamped.</p>
<p>“After a really long political season, that went all the way into 2021, people just want results,” Wyden said in a phone interview from Oregon,<b> </b>advocating for his proposals to create a uniform system for unemployment aid and tie jobless support to economic conditions “so you eliminate these cliffs.”</p>
<p>While extra unemployment benefits don’t lapse until March 14, a gap in payments is already inevitable in much of the country because it takes states time to process the new federal infusion, which would be increased to $400 a week under Biden’s plan. Other aid the proposal would provide — like hundreds of dollars in monthly help for families with children and subsidized Wi-Fi for kids in virtual classes — is expected to take months longer to distribute.</p>
<br />
<p>For proof of the political consequences that can bedevil a signature economic plan seen as insufficient, Biden need look no further than his own time as vice president. The Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus bill, signed into law on Feb. 17 of the new president's term, was later dinged as too small. But one veteran of that push said the best thing Biden's team can do to is keep pushing.</p>
<p>“There's no instant gratification when it comes to Congress and big legislative packages,” said Ben LaBolt, a top White House press aide during the Obama administration who's<b> </b>now a partner at the consulting group Bully Pulpit Interactive. “The best thing President Biden can do is to be shown advocating for this every single day.&quot;</p>
<p>The majority party’s aspiration to get Covid aid signed into law by the second week of March may prove too ambitious because it hinges on a trouble-free journey through the Senate, where the debate has already <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/08/democrats-progressive-immigration-stimulus-467673" target="_blank">divided Democrats on issues like sending stimulus checks to undocumented immigrants</a> and raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The reconciliation process Democrats are using to get the package through the 50-50 Senate with a simple majority could also spur delays, since parliamentary fouls would require complicated rewrites to make the bill text work under the special budget rules.</p>
<p>The weeks that Congress will need to wrap up work on the aid package, however, will pale in comparison to the administrative rigmarole that’s expected to delay some of the bill’s tangible assistance for months after it gets signed into law.</p>
<p>The majority of the more than 18 million Americans who remain on unemployment insurance are set to lose their benefits over several weeks beginning March 14, with delays of weeks or months for many of them as some states reprogram antiquated unemployment systems to get the money out to jobless workers.</p>
<p>Congress needs to act two to three weeks before an unemployment cliff to head off that gap, experts estimate. Given how long it takes the Labor Department to issue guidance and then for states to verify workers' eligibility, that window of opportunity is expected to close by month’s end, long before the stimulus is signed into law.</p>
<p>State unemployment offices are already processing more than 800,000 new jobless claims per week. “It’s just a madhouse,” said Elizabeth Pancotti, policy director at the pro-worker group Employ America.</p>
<br />
<p>And getting aid money out quickly is crucial to keeping the economy afloat after the hit it took from the coronavirus, economists warn, given that any lapses in assistance will lead to a drop in consumer spending. Spending among low- and middle-income Americans who are receiving stimulus checks and unemployment benefits is slightly higher than it was before the pandemic, heavily bolstering the economy even though 10 million people remain unemployed.</p>
<p>“When people talk about how startlingly strong the rebound was out of the depths of the initial part of the crisis, that was predicated on unprecedented support” from the federal government, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.</p>
<p>The start-and-stop nature of unemployment aid and other benefits is already weighing on consumer behavior, dampening the effects on the broader economy, Swonk and other economists warn. If people are unable to count on regular unemployment checks or anticipate a change in the amount of benefits they are getting, they will spend less.</p>
<p>&quot;It creates uncertainty, and uncertainty is a tax on the economy,” Swonk said.</p>
<p>Among the stimulus policies that would most significantly increase cash to Americans, the package would boost the child tax credit and allow families to receive that money on a monthly basis, providing up to $300 a month per kid. But the IRS would not have to start offering those monthly payments until July 1.</p>
<p>The case for expanding the child tax credit as an immediate stimulus “is weaker given the timing challenge,” said Garrett Watson of the Tax Foundation, noting that there is also an argument for expanding the credit to reduce child poverty over the long term.</p>
<p>The IRS would also be charged with sending out new stimulus checks of up to $1,400 while at the same time facing the tidal wave of tax filing season. Leaders in the tax industry have already called on lawmakers to ensure the overburdened agency is not ordered to swiftly distribute all stimulus checks to the detriment of its core mission of collecting taxes.</p>
<p>John Koskinen, who served as IRS commissioner from 2013 through 2017, said the agency did “amazingly well” distributing stimulus checks last year despite being underfunded and short thousands of employees since a decade ago.</p>
<p>“But there's a limit to what new things you can ask them to do without threatening the entire system,” Koskinen warned.</p>
<br />
<p>In another tall order, the stimulus would require the Small Business Administration to launch a $25 billion restaurant grant program that the industry has been fighting for since the early months of the pandemic. Since then, about 17 percent of restaurants have closed, according to the National Restaurant Association.</p>
<p>The SBA, which has faced unprecedented demands from Congress during the economic and health crisis, has not fully implemented relief efforts from December’s economic aid package. The most glaring example is a $15 billion grant program for shuttered live venues that has not yet launched and has no official start date.</p>
<p>Under the stimulus, the Federal Communications Commission also would receive $7.6 billion to subsidize Wi-Fi hot spots and other devices to help students connect to virtual classes. But the agency would get two months to set up rules for doing so, likely releasing that assistance with just a few weeks left in the school year.</p>
<p>At the state level, officials are already running out of cash from the previous stimulus.</p>
<p>“We’ve already had cities, counties, municipalities cutting staff to pay for Covid expenses,” Kansas State Treasurer Lynn Rogers said Thursday during a call hosted by the advocacy group Invest in America Action.</p>
<p>Several states have yet to even begin distributing some of the unemployment assistance granted under the pandemic aid package that became law in late December.</p>
<p>Some centrist lawmakers in both parties warned congressional leaders early in the process that enacting a massive aid package would result in painful delays. Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.), co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, said Congress should peel off funding for vaccines, as well as an extension of unemployment benefits, and pass those portions as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There is now “a cliff hanging over Congress’ and the president’s desire to act,” Reed said. “There should be no reason to have that unofficial deadline of unemployment holding up what could otherwise be good policy.”</p>

<br />
<p>The Biden Justice Department is showing no sign of letting up in a two-year-old legal fight against a former White House aide who became an outspoken critic of former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>While the Justice Department has sought to pause or drop a number of high-profile court battles due to the change in administration, government lawyers are pressing on aggressively with a lawsuit claiming that Omarosa Manigault Newman failed to file a required financial disclosure following <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/omarosa-leaving-white-house-294375" target="_blank">her attention-grabbing firing</a> in December 2017.</p>
<p>Manigault Newman has described the suit as a vendetta aimed at her for turning on Trump, calling him a racist and making revealing disclosures about the former president and his top aides. She also wrote a tell-all book, “Unhinged,” which chronicles her dealings with Trump as a contestant on “The Apprentice” and later as his most prominent African American White House aide.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000177-ba8b-d713-a777-fecf11540000" target="_blank">a new brief filed in federal court </a>in Washington just before midnight Thursday, the Justice Department forcefully defended its position in the case, even tangling with Manigault Newman over the contentious circumstances of her dismissal by then-White House chief of staff John Kelly.</p>
<p>“She…made no attempt to file any Termination Report before September 2019, more than a year and a half after it was due and after this litigation was commenced,” DOJ lawyers wrote. “Then, following that submission—in which only half the required fields were even filled out—Defendant made no effort for over a year to correct her submission, despite being promptly advised of its deficiencies…She remains out of compliance with [the Ethics in Government Act] to this day.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/25/justice-department-omarosa-financial-disclosure-1382392" target="_blank">The suit</a> asks U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon to impose a civil penalty of $61,585 on Manigault Newman for willfully refusing to file the financial disclosure. Such suits are rare. Disputes over financial disclosures are typically resolved by an employee updating the forms and, in some instances, incurring a small penalty.</p>
<p>Manigault Newman’s main defense in the case has been that — after her acrimonious departure from the White House — Trump aides refused to return her personal effects, including financial records she needed to complete the required exit report. She also asserts that she is a whistleblower on government wrongdoing and that the lawsuit amounts to illegal retaliation for that.</p>
<p>After her dismissal, Manigault Newman released audio recordings she secretly made of a tense conversation with Kelly held in the highly-secure White House Situation Room — as well as a recording of another conversation where Trump implausibly asserted he was unaware Kelly planned to fire her. </p>
<p>In the audio, Kelly encourages Manigault Newman to go quietly so she “can go on without any kind of difficulty relative to her reputation.” It later emerged that Kelly said Manigault Newman had abused the White House car service. She contends that was a pretext for firing her.</p>
<p>While the new Justice Department brief argues that statement by Kelly was not a threat and maintains that she was fired for “misuse of government resources,” government lawyers also contend those disputes are irrelevant to the ongoing suit.</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding Defendant’s unfounded references to ‘threats’ at the time of her termination, the merits of Defendant’s termination from the White House are not at issue in this case,” the attorneys wrote. </p>
<p>The brief was submitted under the name of the acting head of Justice’s Civil Division, Brian Boynton, who assumed that role just after President Joe Biden’s inauguration last month. Biden has yet to name a nominee to take that post permanently.</p>
<p>Manigault Newman declined to comment Friday. Her attorney, John Phillips, said he plans a response rebutting the latest filing.</p>
<p>&quot;I just can’t understand how they can argue, in any good faith whatsoever, that depriving her of her boxes and depriving her of accurate information, can in any way be constituted willful non-compliance by Omarosa until those issues are remedied,&quot; Phillips said. &quot;Add to this all of the relevant dates of referrals, tweets and email exchanges, and this was clearly retaliatory. Further, other officials were not similarly referred.&quot;</p>
<p>Just last week, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/08/justice-department-melania-trump-book-467688" target="_blank">dropped a lawsuit against another Trump White House adviser</a>, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who worked as a volunteer aide to former first lady Melania Trump. That suit alleged that her book about her time at the White House, &quot;Melania and Me,&quot; violated a nondisclosure agreement Winston Wolkoff signed. </p>
<p>Department lawyers offered no official explanation to the court for the abrupt shift in that case. A Justice Department official offered only a vague statement, saying: &quot;The Department evaluated the case and concluded that dismissal without prejudice was in the best interests of the United States based on the facts and the law.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>The House is readying to wade into another election integrity fight — this time to decide the legitimacy of one of its own members.</p>
<p>With a contested presidential race and impeachment crisis behind it, Congress is turning to a Democratic candidate’s claim that Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks was improperly declared the winner of their match-up last fall. That candidate, Rita Hart, has formally contested her 6-vote loss — one of the closest federal elections in recent history — possibly placing lawmakers in the uncomfortable position of having to determine whether it seated the wrong woman in January.</p>
<p>The House Administration Committee gathered virtually Friday afternoon to finalize the process by which it will adjudicate Hart’s claim, which was filed under the Federal Contested Elections Act. The committee has been largely silent since Hart first made her contest in December, but the hearing suggests that it is preparing to review the matter further.</p>
<p>In question is the outcome of just one district — but Democrats hold only a five-seat majority in the House, making even a small change in numbers significant.</p>
<p>The Friday meeting was brief. Members unanimously agreed to a resolution that establishes procedures the committee will abide by as it considers recent elections contested under the act.<b> </b>The committee has yet to act on a request by Miller-Meeks to dismiss Hart’s contest. A formal refusal to dismiss is what would truly set an investigation into motion, opening up a lengthy discovery period during which the campaigns can submit evidence and the committee could request ballots or even send staff into the southeastern Iowa district.</p>
<p>Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), the ranking member, on Friday urged the members not to take up the contest, warning they would set a &quot;dangerous precedent&quot; if they legitimize Hart's decision to appeal to the House before exhausting all legal remedies in Iowa.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't think of a worst first step this committee could take in a new Congress than to waste taxpayer dollars by moving forward with overturning this election,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>At the center of Hart’s complaint are 22 ballots that her campaign says were improperly rejected. She has made the experiences of these voters central to her post-campaign messaging: They have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tmLfN-s2h8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">taped videos</a> and called into virtual campaign events to express their disappointment at being disenfranchised. One voter accidentally ripped her ballot envelope while sealing it but was told it would count anyway. Another received an absentee ballot that was already sealed and was told to reopen it<b> </b>and then tape it shut. </p>
<p>“We are glad to see the House Committee on Administration taking action towards ensuring that every legally-cast vote is counted in this race and that all Iowans’ voices are heard,” Hart campaign manager Zach Meunier said in a statement. “Every legal voter in this country has a right to have their ballot counted and the remedy here is clear — count the ballots.”</p>
<p>Lawyers for Hart’s campaign, led by Marc Elias, the Democratic Party’s premier election attorney, said Hart would have won by a 9-vote margin if these votes were counted.</p>
<p>A former state senator and Army doctor who had already run three times for the seat over the past decade and a half, Miller-Meeks said Hart’s contest has no merit. Her lawyers have taken issue with Hart’s decision not to exhaust all state remedies before appealing to the House. </p>
<p>The two women were running to replace now-retired Rep. Dave Loebsack (D-Iowa), who had defeated Miller-Meeks in 2008, 2010 and 2014.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi punted on the issue by provisionally seating Miller-Meeks in January instead of choosing to leave the seat open while the administration committee reviewed Hart’s contest. A refusal to seat the certified winner of a congressional race would be rare.</p>
<p>But now, this investigation could force House Democrats to decide if they want to remove a member of the opposite party that’s already been serving for months. And any kind of resolution is still weeks away — if not longer.</p>
<p>Besides Hart, Republican congressional candidate Jim Oberweis also filed a contest for his more than 5,000-vote loss against Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood in Illinois.</p>
<p>To deal with past contested elections, the Administration Committee, chaired by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), has set up a task force to oversee an investigation or recount. That panel would make a recommendation based on its findings to the entire House, which could then vote on who should hold the seat. </p>
<p>That task force would likely include only a few members, perhaps from the Subcommittee on Elections. Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), a former state Supreme Court justice, is the chair of that subcommittee. Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) is the ranking member of<b> </b>the administration committee.</p>
<p>The last time the House chose to overturn a state-certified election was an acrimonious affair. After the 1984 elections, the House Democratic majority refused to seat the Republican challenger to Democratic Rep. Frank McCloskey. A Republican official in Indiana certified the GOP candidate, Richard McIntyre, as the winner, but a recount conducted by Congress found McCloskey won by 4 votes. When the House Democrats voted to seat McCloskey, Republicans stormed out of the chamber in protest.</p>
<p>Davis cited that controversy in his remarks at the hearing.</p>
<p>&quot;Ballots that were not legal under the state law were suddenly determined legal votes under new rules invented by a partisan task force, who completely rejected state law,&quot; Davis said. &quot;They changed the rules of the game after the game had already been played. And that's exactly what could be happening 35 years later.&quot;</p>
<p>For a while, House Democrats worried they might have to grapple with two contested 2020 elections. The rematch between GOP Rep. Claudia Tenney and former Democratic Rep. Anthony Brindisi in upstate New York only just came to a conclusion after a monthslong battle over the counting of provisional ballots. A state Supreme Court judge ordered Tenney to be certified as the winner, and Brindisi — citing a desire for closure — declined to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>Republicans have made the case that Hart should do the same.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — Rep. Tom Reed was pulled off on the side of an upstate New York road, somewhere along the 40-mile stretch between Ithaca and Corning, being berated for about 45 minutes straight.</p>
<p>On the other end of the line: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
<p>“I've never seen something like it,” Reed (R-N.Y.) said<b> </b>in an interview. “I've heard about the wrath and his anger, and that was the one time where I received it personally.”</p>
<p>It was 2017 and Republicans in Congress were pushing through a tax overhaul with significant implications for New York. The Democratic governor was incensed about the bill — particularly its cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, a provision that remains a perpetual target of Cuomo’s ire — and was lobbying hard for the congressional delegation to oppose it.</p>
<p>Reed, who backed the legislation, said Cuomo’s anger seared itself in his memory for how over the top it was, tattering their professional relationship since.</p>
<p>“That leadership gets old,” he said. “I think people — New Yorkers — get sick of it.”</p>
<p>Similar experiences for other New York political figures, only a fraction of<b> </b>which are public knowledge, have become commonplace in recent years and transcend political affiliation and other dividing lines. Many describe receiving angry calls late in the evening, or at other inopportune times, and being unable to get off the phone with<b> </b>New York’s most powerful official. Warnings and browbeating aren’t unusual, say those familiar with the governor’s approach.</p>
<p>“Anybody who knows the Cuomo administration knows that threats are what they consider their charm,” said a former Democratic elected official who has been on the end of several such calls.</p>
<p>Now, Cuomo’s cutthroat tactics —<b> </b>already<b> </b>the stuff of legend in Albany’s halls of power — have been on full display as the Democratic governor faces his biggest firestorm in years over his administration’s handling of nursing home fatalities during Covid-19 and his unsparing treatment of lawmakers who have dared to step out against him.</p>
<br />
<p>Cuomo’s unrestrained polemic Wednesday against state Assembly member Ron Kim, until recently a relatively low-profile rank-and-file Democratic legislator, has put an exclamation point on the hardball politics that New York City lawmakers, as well as political operatives inside and outside the state, have long bristled at — but largely felt it was unproductive to challenge in public.</p>
<p>“That’s classic Andrew Cuomo,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose asymmetric warfare with the governor has landed him on the hot seat countless times, <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2021/02/18/de-blasio-rips-bullying-cuomo-over-nursing-home-controversy-1364225" target="_blank">said Thursday on MSNBC</a>. “A lot of people in New York state have received those phone calls. The bullying is nothing new.”</p>
<p>Kim, whose uncle died in a nursing home during the pandemic, has been on a media tour recounting what he said are the governor’s attempts to intimidate him over the phone. The lawmaker said Cuomo called him and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/17/politics/cuomo-ron-kim-nursing-home/index.html?source=email" target="_blank">threatened to publicly destroy</a> him if he did not change his statements about a Cuomo aide’s admission that the state had deliberately withheld information on the full death toll at nursing homes.</p>
<p>Cuomo responded Wednesday by publicly accusing Kim of engaging in unethical behavior unrelated to the current scandal, claiming the Assembly member “was influenced by campaign money and pay-to-play.” The governor’s aides reinforced the attack, saying Kim has been duplicitous and untruthful in a way that justifies their show of force, though they denied the governor had threatened his fellow Democrat.</p>
<p>“At no time did anyone threaten to 'destroy' anyone with their 'wrath' nor engage in a 'cover-up.' That's beyond the pale and is unfortunately part of a yearslong pattern of lies by Mr. Kim against this administration,&quot; Cuomo senior adviser Rich Azzopardi said in a statement released Wednesday.</p>
<p>Such is life on the wrong side of Cuomo, whose credo for those who stand in his path was coined early in his first term by one of their own: “We operate on two speeds here: Get along, and kill,&quot; Steve Cohen, then Cuomo’s top aide, said in an exchange first reported by the <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Heavyweight-bouts-2394564.php" target="_blank">Connecticut Post in 2011</a>.</p>
<p>The characterization, which came during a contentious discussion with former Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy’s team, has come to define the Queens native’s modus operandi to the point of becoming a clich&eacute; in New York political circles. (POLITICO on Thursday confirmed the 2011 exchange with multiple people around Malloy at the time.)</p>
<p>The proverb has even become something akin to a badge of honor for some Cuomo staffers in the years since, cocksure in their belief of their boss' singular ability to bend the state government apparatus to fulfill his vision of<b> </b>Democratic politics.</p>
<p>Cuomo’s allies note he’s faced similar criticisms over his instincts nearly his entire time in the public eye — his disastrous first attempt at the governor’s mansion nearly 20 years ago aside — but he nonetheless has handily won the four statewide contests he has entered and proved himself to be a prodigious fundraiser <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/09/13/cuomo-wins-new-york-democratic-primary-for-governor-8856649" target="_blank">unafraid to use that war chest</a> against less-flush opponents.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a governor who works night and day to move the ball down the field for New Yorkers and they know that, which is why he has been elected and re-elected three times over the last 10 years,” Azzopardi said in a statement<b> </b>to POLITICO<b> </b>Thursday.</p>
<p>Tales of the governor’s bare-knuckle tactics are legion in New York and date back years, all the way to his tutelage under his father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, whom the younger Cuomo reveres and has long been fiercely protective of.</p>
<p>The current governor, a diligent news-clip consumer, shares his late father’s penchant for phone calls at odd hours to reporters and others when he comes across something he finds disagreeable. (Mario’s moonlighting as a media ombudsman was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/22/nyregion/news-analysis-cuomo-and-the-press-time-of-tension.html" target="_blank">extensively documented</a> in a 1986 New York Times article.)</p>
<p>“This is a feature of Andrew Cuomo, this is not a bug,” New York Republican Party Chair Nick Langworthy told reporters in Albany on Thursday. “How many times have you in the media received that bullying, screaming phone call from the governor or one of his minions?“</p>
<p>The cajoling can drag on for the better part of an hour and is typically heavily one-sided as the governor expounds on his belief that his position is the correct one, according to people who have been on the receiving end of those calls. Calls from his aides can play out in similar fashion.</p>
<p>Privately, many will recount all manner of vitriol sent their way by people in Cuomoworld that they find unsettling and beyond what they encounter elsewhere in a state redolent with tough-talk.</p>
<p>The aggressive posture extends throughout the governor’s office and top figures across numerous state agencies and the Democratic Party apparatus he effectively controls. Some of the strongest invective from Cuomo’s camp has not come from him, but from aides and outside allies — though they have <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/04/war-of-words-continues-over-derosa-appointment-111356" target="_blank">crossed the line</a> into offensiveness on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>The most recent broadsides<b> </b>against Kim and other legislative critics <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/18/andrew-cuomo-frenemies-democrats-469874" target="_blank">have riled many members of the Legislature</a> who have recoiled at the governor’s vilification of him.</p>
<p>“We have no interest in name calling — we aim to restore the proper balance of power between the Legislature and Executive,” reads a statement more than a dozen Assembly Democrats signed backing up Kim.</p>
<p>The disproportionate responses to anodyne disagreements and an unrelenting insistence on control have at times drawn unflattering comparisons to former Presidents Donald Trump and Richard Nixon, among others.</p>
<p>Still it's unclear what, if any, lasting impact the saga will have on Cuomo’s image or political power. Potential challengers of both major parties are studiously gauging <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2021/02/16/is-cuomo-wounded-enough-to-take-down-1363767" target="_blank">whether he’s vulnerable enough to take down</a> if he seeks a fourth term but have yet to officially take the plunge.</p>
<p>There are still plenty of power players who find it fruitful to be on the “get along” side of Cuomo’s ledger.</p>
<p>“While we differ at times, it’s always been a professional, open-door working relationship,” said state<b> </b>Sen. Joe Addabbo (D-Queens), who's previously found himself at odds with Cuomo on sports betting and other issues.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he said he’s heard plenty of “horror stories.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t been as unfortunate as other colleagues with the wrath,” he said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>TALLAHASSEE — Florida is getting four federally-backed Covid-19 vaccination hubs in largely low-income communities of color, an announcement that comes after Gov. Ron DeSantis initially clashed with the Biden administration over federal vaccine help.</p>
<p>The new sites, which were announced Friday, will be in areas of Jacksonville, Tampa, Miami and Orlando picked through a federal vulnerability index that considered things like minority population, socioeconomic status and housing types. When up and running in roughly two weeks, the four sites are expected to collectively give 12,000 daily vaccines, giving a boost to areas that have most struggled to secure vaccines. </p>
<p>The four new federal vaccination locations were selected as part of a partnership between Florida, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each hub will be staffed predominantly by federal employees and have “spokes” that reach out to communities around the main vaccine location. Those locations will be selected by Florida officials. </p>
<p>The announcement was made through separate press releases sent by DeSantis’ office and the White House. DeSantis made no mention of the four new federally backed vaccination sites during a public event held shortly before they were announced. That event in Palm Beach County was set up by DeSantis’ taxpayer-funded office, but had the appearance of a campaign rally, including a cheering audience and at least one attendee wearing a shirt that said “<a href="https://twitter.com/Mdixon55/status/1362787816867057666" target="_blank">Masks are Slavery</a>.”</p>
<p>When asked for comment about the new vaccine sites, DeSantis’ office referred POLITICO to public statements the governor made during a Thursday press conference.</p>
<p>“They [the federal government] do want to do it through FEMA,” he said. “So we said, look, if it's additional doses for Florida, we want to participate because we want to get as many doses as we can [obtain]. So we hope to be able to get some of those here in Florida.”</p>
<p>Last month, DeSantis dismissively referred to the Biden administration's planned vaccine sites as “FEMA camps.”</p>
<p>His administration has taken what it calls a “senior first” approach, focusing on elderly populations, including going on <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/94-year-old-veteran-vaccine-florida-live-fox-friends-desantis-rollout-phizer" target="_blank">Fox and Friends</a> to give shots to war veterans on live television. Florida has given more than 2.6 million vaccines, but, like other states, has faced criticism for racial disparities: only roughly 5 percent of vaccines have gone to Black residents. The criticism intensified this week after DeSantis established a pop-up vaccine site in <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2021/02/17/desantis-defends-opening-vaccine-pop-up-site-in-affluent-mostly-white-community-1363903" target="_blank">Lakewood Ranch</a>, a wealthy, predominantly white Manatee County development. The move came one week after a task force set up to identify vaccination sites in minority communities said DeSantis’ office did not respond when they sent their blueprint. </p>
<p>&quot;For some reason, Florida is a little hesitant about working collectively, with a group of volunteers who reached out our arms and not our fists,&quot; R.B. Holmes, the pastor of the Tallahassee-based Bethel Missionary Baptist Church and chairman of the task force, said last week. &quot;But that's why the federal government is so important. ... If it were just states' rights, we'd still be living under Jim Crowism.&quot; </p>
<p>DeSantis said the Lakewood Ranch vaccination sites, which were facilitated by local GOP donor Pat Neal, were picked because of a high concentration of elderly people and no political considerations were made. </p>
<p>That decision, however, has helped fuel DeSantis' critics.</p>
<p>“DeSantis doesn’t want these federal sites to open in Florida but after his stunt this week in Manatee County, it’s crystal clear that we do not need federal assistance to ensure the underserved have equitable access to the vaccination,” said state Sen. Janet Cruz (D-Tampa). “In addition to access, federal and state partners need to work together to engage in robust vaccine education to build trust in communities of color.”</p>
<p>Florida Democrats who have long been critical of DeSantis’ pandemic response, framed the announcement as the Biden administration swooping in to bolster Florida’s vaccine infrastructure, even as the White House notes the new vaccination sites are being done in “partnership” with the state.</p>
<p>“The Biden Administration, with our support in Congress, is surging vaccine resources to the American people,” said Rep. <a href="https://cd.politicopro.com/member/259481" target="_blank" data-person-id="259481">Val Demings</a>, an Orlando Democrat. “I am pleased to report that one of Florida’s new Community Vaccination Sites will be here in Orlando.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>Federal prosecutors have charged nine members of the Oath Keepers — an extremist militia that allegedly played a leading role in the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol — with conspiring to delay the certification of the presidential election.</p>
<p>Leveling the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/case-multi-defendant/file/1369071/download" target="_blank">most sweeping charges since the insurrection,</a> the Justice Department accused the nine militia members of coordinating efforts to storm Congress and noted that they openly discussed maintaining a cache of “heavy” weaponry just outside of D.C. limits.</p>
<p>Three of those named in the new indictment were arrested last month. Six new defendants were arrested this week.</p>
<p>Private text and audio messages show that multiple members of the group claimed to be acting on then-President Donald Trump’s cues, interpreting his call for a “wild” protest on Jan. 6 as an invitation to come stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory. </p>
<p>&quot;Trump said It's gonna be wild!!!!!!! It's gonna be wild!!!!!!!” Kelly Meggs, 52, a leader of Florida’s Oath Keepers, told a Facebook contact in a private message, according to the indictment. “He wants us to make it WILD that's what he's saying. He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are heading to DC pack your shit!!&quot;</p>
<p>And when then-Vice President Mike Pence rejected calls to unilaterally block Biden’s win, one of the leaders of the group, Thomas Caldwell, 65, told his collaborators they were “screwed.”</p>
<p>“Pence has punked out,” the Virginia resident texted at 2:06 p.m., adding, “Teargassing peaceful protesters at capital steps. Getting rowdy here.”</p>
<p>Just 18 minutes later, as the Capitol was being ransacked and lawmakers were fleeing for safety, Trump tweeted an attack on Pence that accused him of lacking the “courage” to overturn the election.</p>
<p>The new charges present the most elaborate case yet against members of an organized group participating in the riot. </p>
<p>Members of the alleged conspiracy agreed to “interfere with the official Congressional proceeding to certify the vote of the Electoral College of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election,” prosecutors said. The defendants also trained and taught each other military tactics, recruited other participants in the attacks and stormed past the Capitol Police barricades at the onset of the insurrection, Justice Department lawyers said.</p>
<p>FBI and DOJ officials <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/26/capitol-riot-investigation-462811" target="_blank">indicated last month</a> they anticipate leveling even more significant charges — including seditious conspiracy — against some Capitol rioters. Indeed, back on Jan. 26, the prosecutor overseeing the hundreds of cases, acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Michael Sherwin, said he expected such charges “very soon.” </p>
<p>The new indictment against the Oath Keepers doesn’t include a sedition charge, but the effort to charge nine defendants in a single case still seems to signal a new phase of the investigation. </p>
<p>Prosecutors have also charged numerous members of the Proud Boys, though there have not been linked indictments issued for most members of the group. And other indictments have described individual rioters’ links to militia groups and efforts to join them.</p>
<p>The new indictment offers a blow-by-blow of the nine Oath Keepers' efforts to coordinate — from the Arlington, Va., hotels they were staying in to the gear they would share, such as communications equipment, goggles and other tactical vests — as well as their communications while they were storming the Capitol. </p>
<p>One unidentified participant told Ohio-based Oath Keeper Jessica Watkins, 38, one of the nine alleged conspirators, that she should be prepared to carry out citizens’ arrests. Watkins allegedly replied, “We are in the mezzanine. We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it.”</p>
<p>As they pressed forward into the building, Caldwell sent a message on Facebook, writing, &quot;We are surging forward. Doors breached.”</p>
<p>At 3:05 p.m., Caldwell wrote in a Facebook message, “Inside.”</p>
<p>In perhaps the most alarming element of the new Oath Keepers indictment, prosecutors revealed multiple private communications in which the alleged conspirators described setting up a weapons cache — known as a Quick Reaction Force, or QRF — just outside of Washington D.C. that they would call in if they decided to ratchet up the violence.</p>
<p>&quot;You guys Gonna carry?&quot; one of the militia members, Kelly Meggs, asked in a Facebook message to another. &quot;Ok we aren't either, we have a heavy QRF 10 Min out though.&quot;</p>
<p>Watkins, another member of the Oath Keepers, later told another alleged conspirator that those storming the Capitol initially would not be bringing guns because “QRF will be our law enforcement members.”</p>
<p>An Oath Keeper mentioned only as “Person 3” in the indictment was identified by Caldwell as the head of this QRF.</p>
<p>Person 3 “will have the goodies in case things go bad and we need to get heavy,” Caldwell told his associates.</p>
<p>The indication that prosecutors have identified, but not named, additional participants in the alleged conspiracy, suggests there are still more details to be revealed and more suspects who will likely be charged.</p>
<p>In addition to Caldwell, Meggs and Watkins, prosecutors indicted Donovan Crowl, 50, of Champaign County, Ohio, Sandra Parker, 60, and Bennie Parker, 70, of Warren County, Ohio; Graydon Young, 54, of Englewood, Fla.; Laura Steele, 52, of Thomasville, N.C.; and Meggs’ wife Connie, 59, of Dunnellon, Fla.</p>
<p>An earlier criminal affidavit against a subset of the nine Oath Keepers described Watkins' efforts to coordinate travel with the Parkers. They indicated that their plans to go to Washington were dependent on weather and parking, and Watkins indicated some discomfort with driving through the mountains of West Virginia and Maryland.</p>
<p>After Jan. 6, when Watkins checked in on the Parkers, Bennie Park said they were doing well but that his wife had been dealing with sinus issues. Watkins called her a “super trooper” for her ability to walk long distances with the rest of the group.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit Rep. Devin Nunes filed in 2019 claiming he was libeled by CNN in reports alleging he was involved in an effort to dig up Ukraine-related dirt on Joe Biden.</p>
<p>In a ruling Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain granted the news network’s motion to dismiss the suit, which sought a whopping $435 million in damages.</p>
<p>CNN’s story asserted that a witness was prepared to testify that Nunes, then-chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a close ally of former President Donald Trump, met with former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin in Vienna in 2018 to gather information that might be politically damaging to Biden.</p>
<p>Nunes adamantly denied the allegation and named CNN in a flurry of lawsuits he filed against news organizations in 2019.</p>
<p>CNN said it wasn’t vouching for the accuracy of the account about Nunes but was relaying testimony available from a witness to the matter, Lev Parnas, a businessman who worked closely with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani.</p>
<p>Swain dismissed the suit against CNN on a technical ground: She found California law applied to the case and Nunes had failed to request a retraction as required under the laws of the Golden State. Nunes’ lawyer had argued that the laws of Virginia or Washington, D.C., should apply, but the judge said it made the most sense to apply the laws of Nunes’ home state to the dispute.</p>
<br />
<iframe style="max-width: 100%" width="1280" height="720" src="https://players.brightcove.net/1155968404/r1WF6V0Pl_default/index.html?videoId=6233684081001" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
<br />
<p>“Plaintiff … argues that, if the Court were to look to the place where he suffered the greatest injury, the laws of either Virginia or the District of Columbia should apply because that is where he performs his role overseeing the activities of the Intelligence Community,” Swain wrote in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.537539/gov.uscourts.nysd.537539.48.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">her 18-page decision</a>.</p>
<p>“Nunes does not proffer any additional facts that support his conclusory statement that he suffered substantial injury in either Virginia or District of Columbia, much less a greater injury there than in the home state that sends him to Congress as the representative of his district. His Amended Complaint alleges that he is a citizen of California and details his long family ties with, and extensive political service in and for, the state of California and its citizens,” wrote the judge, who is a Clinton appointee.</p>
<p>Nunes initially filed the suit in federal court in Richmond, Va., but a judge there granted CNN’s motion to move the suit to Manhattan. The network said the author of the web version of the story, Vicky Ward, and the host of Cuomo Prime Time, Chris Cuomo, are both based in New York, as is Parnas’ lawyer, Joseph Bondy.</p>
<p>Nunes’ attorney in the CNN suit and the slew of other cases he has filed, Steven Biss, did not respond to an email seeking comment on the ruling.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>PIERRE, S.D. — U.S. Sen. John Thune is criticizing Republican activists and party leaders for engaging in “cancel culture” by rushing to censure GOP senators who found former President Donald Trump guilty of inciting an insurrection.</p>
<p>In his first interview since he voted to acquit Trump, the Senate's No. 2 Republican on Thursday defended fellow Republicans who sided with Democrats on the “vote of conscience” and warned against shutting out dissenting voices in the party.</p>
<p>“There was a strong case made,” Thune said of the Democrats' impeachment presentation. “People could come to different conclusions. If we’re going to criticize the media and the left for cancel culture, we can’t be doing that ourselves.”</p>
<p>Thune's remarks were his first explaining his vote in Trump's trial and assessing the turbulent GOP politics the former president has left behind. Thune, who is facing reelection next year in deeply conservative South Dakota, is among several establishment Republicans grappling with how to reclaim control of a party dominated by Trump and his most ardent supporters for years.</p>
<p>The senator only rarely criticized Trump while he was in office. But he called the former president's actions after the election “inexcusable&quot; and accused him of undermining the peaceful transfer of power.</p>
<p>Still, Thune last week <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-donald-trump-impeachments-trump-impeachment-mitch-mcconnell-0a14d2e41e376331580b98a992f7d856" target="_blank">sided with most Republican senators and GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell in voting</a> to acquit anyway. Thune and others argued that Trump could not be impeached because he was already out of office. Thune said after his vote that he was concerned with the idea of “punishing a private citizen with the sole intent of disqualifying him from holding future office.” Democrats fell 10 votes short of the 67 need to convict.</p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mitch-mcconnell-feud-gop-6737e14155cf65b6fc68d7ae5c3ceb5f" target="_blank">Trump has lashed out at McConnell and repeated the baseless claim that he won the election. </a>The comments have inflamed a feud that is likely to play out in GOP primaries between Trump-backed candidates and those supported by the establishment wing.</p>
<p>Thune suggested he would be taking steps to assist candidates &quot;who don’t go off and talk about conspiracies and that sort of thing.” He praised Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, who was censured by the Wyoming GOP for voting to impeach Trump, for doing an “exceptional job on most issues&quot; and said he was ready to jump into primary battles like the one she is sure to face.</p>
<p>“At the grassroots level, there’s a lot of people who want to see Trump-like candidates,” he said. “But I think we’re going to be looking for candidates that are electable.”</p>
<p>Thune himself was hit by Trump last year after he said efforts by some GOP members in the U.S. House to reject Electoral College results would “go down like a shot dog” in the Senate. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-media-south-dakota-social-media-f184932e1dddde9ace5374f1d059164a" target="_blank">Trump called Thune</a> a “RINO,” meaning Republican In Name Only, and “Mitch’s boy,” in reference to McConnell. The attacks inspired some Trump loyalists in South Dakota <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-south-dakota-pierre-elections-9d222929b080274c98232f3fd2179f33" target="_blank">to huddle for a primary challenge</a> to the state's senior senator, whose candidacy has gone unchallenged in previous elections.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the senator attempted to downplay those attacks, likening them to “food fights within the family&quot; that hurt Republicans' goals, He noted there was no evidence to support Trump's claim of voter fraud.</p>
<p>“You’ve got to face the music, and at some point, it’s got to be over and you’ve got to move on,” he said, adding, “I think it’s just important to tell people the truth. The most important responsibility of any leader is to define reality.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>NASA is getting ready for the Biden administration’s expected boost in climate science research, the agency’s acting head told POLITICO on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Steve Jurczyk, who worked at NASA for more than three decades before becoming acting administrator last month, said he will have a better idea of the Biden administration’s space priorities at the end of this month, when the White House gives NASA feedback on its fiscal 2022 budget request that was drafted under the prior administration. </p>
<p>But from early conversations with the White House, NASA is already reviewing its Earth science portfolio for ways to pick up the pace.</p>
<p>“We're just taking a look at our Earth science decadal survey … and the missions that would get to make those measurements to particularly support climate research and looking at how we might accelerate those,” Jurczyk said in an interview. “We're doing some preparatory work expecting that that's going to be a request when we hear back from the OMB on the pass back.” </p>
<p>One program that could potentially be accelerated is the <a href="https://clarreo-pathfinder.larc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory Pathfinder</a> program, which measures sunlight reflected by the Earth more accurately than existing tools to improve climate models. </p>
<p>“[There will be] more conversations around exactly what we're going to accelerate there, but the CLARREO Pathfinders is an example of something that I know will move forward,” he said. </p>
<p>Jurczyk also talked about his priorities as acting administrator and upcoming NASA missions.</p>

<br />
<p><i>This transcript has been edited for length and clarity.</i></p>
<p><b>What are your priorities for the agency?</b></p>
<p>My primary focus is going to be on keeping our programs on track, particularly the major programs ... that come to me for review and approval. We have a lot to accomplish this year across all all the mission areas. ... That obviously starts Thursday with safely landing the Perseverance rover on Mars along with the Ingenuity helicopter. That's followed a couple of days later by a Northrop Grumman cargo flight to the station. We're evaluating the Boeing second uncrewed test flight on the Commercial Crew. Right now it's no earlier than March 25. Then we have the Crew-2 mission to station, [which is] the second operational mission for SpaceX on a commercial crew no earlier than April 20. I believe we have six launches this year across the four areas in the science mission director.</p>
<p>Of course, the most critical to us is the James Webb Space Telescope. That team has done an amazing job keeping integration and test of the observatory moving forward, given the challenges with Covid. They're still on track for the end of October launch. ... My focus is going to be to keep those important missions and those important milestones over the coming months, while continuing to protect the health and safety of our workforce because ... it will be a while before we're on the other side of Covid. </p>
<p><b>Have you made any changes yet to reflect the Biden administration's plans for NASA?</b></p>
<p>That's coming. We've had some initial discussions, but I think the first real direction we're going to get is when the White House and the Office of Management and Budget give us a pass back for the [fiscal 2022] budget. We worked through the reconciliation process to develop our [fiscal 2022] president's budget request. OMB has told us we should expect a pass back at the end of February. I think that'll be our first indication as to the priorities for the new administration and the changes we need to make through our [fiscal 2022] initial proposal that we submitted to the previous administration in September. </p>
<p><b>Many expect an increased focus on climate science and on diversity in STEM. Have there been any changes yet?</b></p>
<p>Not yet, although you're exactly right. Those are the priorities we're hearing our discussion with the new administration, so there's no surprise there. We're just taking a look at our Earth science decadal survey … and the missions that would get to make those measurements to particularly support climate research and looking at how we might accelerate those. </p>
<p>We're doing some preparatory work expecting that that's going to be a request when we hear back from the OMB on the pass back. </p>
<p>Our office of STEM engagement is continually looking not only at the programs that they manage that get appropriated to our STEM budget line in our appropriations, but also working on a tremendous amount of activities across all of the mission directorates. ... We have been, and we're going to continue to move towards an agency-level integrated plan for engaging everyone from [K-12] through post-graduate. I think that's going to be important moving forward with the new administration.</p>
<p><b>Any specific programs from the decadal survey that are candidates to accelerate?</b></p>
<p>We expect missions like the [Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory] Pathfinder to be moving forward. ... We've been making Earth radiation budget measurements since 1984, I believe. So we have this multi-decadal record of the Earth's radiation balance, what's coming in from the sun, what's being reflected off the top of the atmosphere and what's being trapped in the system. </p>
<p>CLARREO Pathfinder is an instrument that's going to make multi-spectral, spectrally resolved measurements of that energy coming off the top of the atmosphere, which will help remove uncertainties in climate models, as well as improve our understanding of the Earth's energy balance. That's just an example of one mission that will most likely be supported by the administration moving forward.</p>
<p>We'll look at measurements and instruments and missions where we can get data to improve our modeling, reduce uncertainties in modeling, and that will provide information to help policy makers establish good policy and work with our international partners on agreements. Then we'll use those measurements to verify the effectiveness of those policies. [There will be] more conversations around exactly what we're going to accelerate there, but the CLARREO Pathfinders is an example of something that I know will move forward.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>A national anti-Trump group is launching a $1 million ad campaign to provide backup to Republicans in Congress who voted to impeach or convict former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The Republican Accountability Project, which previously vowed to spend a total of $50 million to back GOP lawmakers who impeached Trump as well as defeat his loyal supporters in office, will air the TV spots on Fox News. The organization, which first shared its plans with POLITICO, is also funding billboards to rally behind the legislators who found Trump guilty of inciting rioters to attack the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>“After our capitol was attacked, our representatives in Congress were threatened, and a police officer was killed, Sen. Murkowksi had a choice,” the narrator in one of the television ads says. “She could look the other way and pretend it didn’t happen or she could stand up and say, ‘This can never happen again.’ Thank you, Sen. Murkowski, for upholding your oath to the constitution and for protecting our country.”</p>
<p>A billboard by the group reads, “Thank you, Rep. Kinzinger for defending the Constitution.”</p>
<p>The effort by never-Trump Republicans comes as the lawmakers who condemned the former president face consequences both in Washington and back home for their votes. The Wyoming GOP censured Rep. Liz Cheney for moving to impeach Trump, and some House Republicans unsuccessfully tried to oust her as conference chair. In Pennsylvania, local parties have censured Sen. Pat Toomey and the state committee is planning to hold a meeting that insiders said will discuss the same punishment. </p>
<p>“It’s a really important thing to do, to thank these Republicans who really took a stand against Trump and took chances that obviously have been challenging and will continue to be challenging,” said Olivia Troye, co-director of the Republican Accountability Project. “You've seen them be censured by their own parties in their own states and districts, and the dynamic that’s come and the hatred and fury that you see from some of the supporters against them.”</p>
<p>Troye said that the organization is targeting voters on Fox News because “there’s a whole voting population of Republican voters right now that are not OK with what happened” as well as Trump voters for whom the Jan. 6 insurrection “really gave them pause.”</p>
<p>The Republican Accountability Project said it will defend all of the House and Senate members who impeached or convicted Trump as part of its campaign, including those who are retiring or not up for reelection in 2022.</p>
<p>The group hopes that it will be able to influence the midterm elections, in part, by encouraging anti-Trump Republicans to run for office, including in battleground states such as Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“It’s really part of the overall goal of the Republican Accountability Project, is to encourage the non-MAGA people out there, encourage principled conservatives, principled Republicans to run and to get involved, and knowing that we will be there in 2022 and 2024,” Troye said.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>For months, Emily has been married to a ghost. The trouble began last summer, when her husband Peter, the man who once showered her with affection and doted on their kids, started to spend all of his free time online, watching videos and reading message boards. He skipped the family activities they had once enjoyed, like watching football and playing outdoor sports. The couple, she recalled, stopped laughing together; everything suddenly turned serious with him. The pandemic had forced Peter to work from home, but it didn’t feel like he was there. </p>
<p>Before long, there were further turns. Peter started saying things that bordered on “bigoted and xenophobic,” Emily told me. Most shocking to her, Peter made her feel like an enemy for disagreeing with him. When she pushed back on his new strange ideas, like Tom Hanks being a pedophile, he answered her with disdain and treated her as if she were stupid.</p>
<p>“I was told that I buried my head in the sand and couldn’t see the ‘real’ problems,” said Emily, who shared her story under the condition of anonymity because she fears Peter’s retaliation and feels disloyal for speaking up. (Emily and Peter are not their real names.) Sometimes he undermined her this way in front of their kids.</p>
<p>Emily knew her husband was wrapped up in something called “QAnon.” She had heard the term before—Peter, prior to his conversion, had once dismissed it as “nuts”—but she didn’t fully grasp what QAnon was until early October, when she watched a few of the videos Peter kept talking about. That was when she learned that her husband had been consumed by a complex and false conspiracy theory that accuses “deep state elites” of running a secret pedophile ring. By then, it was too late to pull him out.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/b3/3f/ed21676f4b749495d2bea0c31121/qanon-mag-04.JPG" />
<br />
<p>That month, Emily read an article online about “QAnonCasualties”—a Reddit forum for people like her, whose loved ones had also been drawn in by the bogus conspiracy theory. Suddenly, she didn’t feel so alone. For the next four days she watched the forum closely until she gathered the courage to post about her husband. “It’s exhausting loving someone and watching them get sucked into this cycle you can’t break,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“Welcome. I hope you find some comfort and support here,” one Redditor commented on her post. “It’s a wonderful group of people who have been in one way or another touched by this rapidly growing cult.” Another woman told her story about creating a fake Q account on Twitter to reach her husband. “They only listen to each other,” she wrote.</p>
<br />
<p>“Thank you all for responding. Just knowing others are going through this disaster is relieving,” Emily replied.</p>
<p>Emily is just one of thousands who have found their way to r/QAnonCasualties. Started in 2019 by a Reddit user whose mother was a part of the “Qult,” the subreddit has ballooned in popularity over the past year,<b> </b>growing from less than a thousand followers in February 2020 to more than 133,000 in February 2021. The group’s followers more than doubled in the weeks following the Capitol riot alone. And as QAnon continues to spread—about 30 percent of Republicans have favorable views about the conspiracy theory, according to a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/4yijjbkc2z/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank">January poll</a> by YouGov—so does the forum’s reach. </p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/bc/d8/5f49cbd44a389e4937a5fff097b7/qanon-mag-03.JPG" />
<br />
<p>As American politics scrambles to deal with this fringe ideology and its followers—a set of people seemingly impervious to facts, some committed enough to assault the U.S. Capitol—the country might learn a few things from the people who have to grapple with QAnon in their very homes, and who live with it every day. And what their stories tell us is unsettling. In post after post on r/QAnonCasualties, fathers and daughters, wives and husbands, best friends and colleagues describe their inability to get through to the people they are closest to. There are stories of marriages and friendships torn asunder, estranged siblings, parents and children severing ties. There are occasional accounts of success. But more often the stories end with people giving up trying to reach their radicalized loved ones. Sometimes, they walk away entirely.</p>
<p>After Emily found the board in October, the tone of her posts quickly went from hopeful to defeated. She began to accept that she might have to leave her husband. One day she wrote:<b> </b>“I would have never married this person, yet somehow, I am [married to him]. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.”</p>
<p>Peter has stopped treating the pandemic seriously, and Emily, who is in a high-risk group, can’t understand. They are both in their early 40s, and over the two decades that they’ve known each other Peter has always been protective of her fragile health. Now he thinks the pandemic is a hoax and doesn’t wear a mask, putting Emily in danger.</p>
<p>So Emily continues to avoid talking about politics and opts to do all of the house chores like groceries herself because she can’t trust Peter to be careful. As she wrote in one post:<b> </b>“This crap means more to him than my life.”</p>
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/77/96/2df3eac34bd7ac831aa20e46d4be/qanon-mag-05.JPG" />
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;">The QAnonCasualties subreddit</span> came to life on July 4, 2019, when user Sqwakomodile shared a story about their mother being consumed by QAnon. </p>
<p>“The ignorance, bigotry, and refusal to question ‘the plan’ have only gotten worse over time,” Sqwakomodile wrote. The user barely talked to their mother anymore, but felt guilty about it. “It only seems to make me feel terrible and feeling like it’s my responsibility to try to lead her back to reality. Having a loved one involved in QAnon is an exhausting, sad, scary, demoralizing experience.”</p>
<p>At the time, QAnon had already made its way out of the far-right chat rooms where it was born<b> </b>and begun to spread via<a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/29/the-qanon-timeline/" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2021/01/29/the-qanon-timeline/" target="_blank">mainstream social media sites like Facebook and Twitter</a>. The conspiracy could be traced back to 2017, when “Q,” an elusive figure whose moniker is derived from the high-level security clearance he claims to possess, started dropping cryptic “hints” on the chat boards 4chan and later 8kun. The basic idea was that Donald Trump was leading a secret effort to overthrow a cabal of Satan-worshipping, blood-drinking, Democratic pedophiles—a cabal that, according to the mythos, includes powerful politicians, Hollywood moguls and journalists. The conspiracy theory’s followers, often referred to as “Qultists” or “Anons” on forums, awaited the arrival of “the storm”—a martial order under which deep state agents like Hillary Clinton and Tom Hanks would be publicly executed.</p>
<p>But that was just the starting point. QAnon has a unique participatory nature that allows Q’s “digital soldiers” to add whatever conspiracies they want to it as long as they fit within the framework that the<b> </b>masses are being lied to by sinister elites. Q, who has been silent since December, used to post hints and leave it up to his willing followers to interpret them with whatever conspiratorial explanation they can find. As a result, today, QAnon has grown into an umbrella for many conspiracies, ranging from the fringe to the absurd. There are claims that vaccines cause autism, that 9/11 was “an inside job,” that John. F. Kennedy Jr. is alive and the government is covering-up the existence of space aliens. Since Trump’s decisive loss in November, the QAnon<b> </b>community has been circulating unfounded accusations of election fraud.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/who-was-ashli-babbitt.html" target="_blank"> Ashli Babbitt</a>, the woman who was shot during the storming of the Capitol, was a QAnon believer—one of many there that day.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/5c/04/236735a942ed957f91d7b2164c12/qanon-mag-02.JPG" />
<br />
<p>QAnon’s malleability is part of what makes it so powerful. “It’s been inclusive in a way that I’ve really never seen any other conspiracy,” said Ethan Zuckerman, an associate professor of public policy, communication and information at the University of Massachusetts and the author of the paper “QAnon and the Emergence of the Unreal.” “You can listen to whoever’s voice is closer to your own. So if you’re not here for satanism, listen to someone who is not playing up the satanic part of it.” QAnon’s participatory nature is also how the conspiracy theory “manages to capture that authenticity, that comes from people genuinely, sincerely, trying to figure out how to make sense of a world that isn’t making any sense to them,” Zuckerman added.</p>
<p>The flexibility has an added benefit: It allows the community to reinterpret Q’s predictions every time they don’t come true. For example, QAnon followers believed President Joe Biden’s inauguration would never happen because Trump planned to expose the deep state elite for committing election fraud, arrest them on live TV and send them to Guantanamo Bay. But after Biden was sworn in, some Anons started to describe him as Trump’s ally, secretly working to bring down the deep state they once considered him to be a part of. Others believe March 4 is the new day for Trump’s inauguration. </p>
<p>“Imagine a prophecy where the prophet gets everything wrong and, somehow, it ends up being even more powerful,” said Zuckerman.</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;">On r/QAnonCasualties forum,</span> most of the post titles reflect the pain of the people behind them. “A little funny, a lot sad. Bye, dad,” “My mother kicked me out for calling Trump racist” and “Way worse than I thought” are all anecdotes of people failing to get through to their loved ones.</p>
<p>In late October, user acidalice posted “Another family wrecked...” and wrote about her partner of two decades. “He’s gone from the kindest, chilled man to constant anger and major depression. I’m at a loss, not so easy to walk away either - been together 20 years, married 14, 2 kids under 10, mortgage.”</p>
<p>“Prioritise your children’s happiness. They deserve a home free of his black moods and anger. So do you,” commented another user.</p>

<br />
<p>In July, so-tired-with-it-now posted <i>Some hope…maybe?</i> about trying to get through to their husband. They read about QAnon and sat him down for a thorough conversation, calmly addressing every argument he made. “I miss my intelligent, kind and caring husband and I’d like him back now please<b>,</b>” so-tired-with-it-now told him. It seemed to work: When the user’s husband started watching videos again, they weren’t conspiracy related.</p>
<p>“I think the golden nugget in this is where you told him that you missed who he was and how great of a person that is,” one of the dozens of comments under the post said.</p>
<p>When Biden won the election in November, many on the forum were hopeful. With Trump out of office, they thought, things would get better. But, after the siege of the Capitol on January 6, Jitarth Jadeja, a former QAnon believer and one of the moderators of the forum, saw a significant shift in the mood of the comments: Family members of Qultists exchanged confusion and guarded optimism for anger. A sudden influx of new members in the wake of the Capitol riot added to the angrier rhetoric and the loss of hope. </p>
<p>“There’s understandably less desire to reach out and try and understand why these people believe what they believe, it’s been replaced by a desire to punish them for their beliefs, as misplaced as they are,” Jadeja said in an email. He said he senses a “looming darkness across all these forums and groups. It feels cold, silent and omnipresent. Everyone is waiting with bated breath to see what happens next.”</p>
<p>In “My Qdad was there,” user -n3rdyl4undry- wrote about feeling angry and terrified after finding out that their father was in D.C. on the day of the insurrection. In the comment section, others expressed support and encouraged -n3rdyl4undry- to report their father to the FBI, which the user did and posted about.</p>
<p>“Dude...why did you let these people talk you into doing that?” someone asked in the comments.</p>
<br />
<p>“Because he is dragging my mom in. He didn’t take her to DC, thank the gods. But what about next time? Or the time after?”</p>
<p>“Look, I believe that snitching is horrible, but domestic terrorism is past the line for me,” said a Redditor approving of -n3rdyl4undry-’s decision. “We are deeply beyond the point of ‘intervention’ here,” agreed another.</p>
<p>For some, though, the Capitol riot turned everything around: In “QHusband breakthrough,” written on January 6, user smorez_89 described their husband going to the bedroom after the news of<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/who-was-ashli-babbitt.html" target="_blank"> </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/us/who-was-ashli-babbitt.html" target="_blank">Ashli Babbit</a>t’s death, coming back with an armload of Trump gear and a couple of books and cutting them all into ribbons. He dumped the scraps in the garbage can and rolled it to the side of the curb.</p>
<p>When he was back, he said “I’m done. I don’t want to be part of this anymore. I’m sorry. I’ll try to be better.”</p>
<br />
<p>On January 10, Steven Hassan, a mental health professional and cult expert who wrote a book called <i>The Cult of Trump</i>, held a Q&amp;A session on five Reddit groups including r/QAnonCasualties in which he talked about mind control and how one might try to de-radicalize a Qultist.</p>
<p>The Q and A accumulated more than 240 comments. Kelseycloud talked about their sister and how frustrating it had been to watch her become a QAnon believer. “She is now on that sinking boat of fear and anxiety, and is back to being incapable of withholding information,” Kelseycloud wrote. “I do my best to maintain a more centrist/neutral position... but it’s hard to see her suffer.”</p>
<p>“How well do you know the QAnon arguments/ ideology?” responded Hassan. He recommended everyone in Kelseycloud’s situation to familiarize themselves with the conspiracy and document beliefs of their Anons and how they change over time.</p>
<p>“When she or he sees you really ‘get it’ but do not believe it, you are in a position to explain why you do not accept the claims/ prophecies,” Hassan wrote. “BUT always take the position that if they can convince you that that ideology is true, you will adopt it too.”</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;">Richard, 77, doesn’t remember when</span> or how exactly he found his way to r/QanonCasualties. He was worried about his brother Mark, 73, and wanted to know if other people were going through the same thing as he was. (For privacy reasons, these are not their real names.) Richard emailed me after he saw my post on the forum asking for people to share their experiences. His outlook today is grim: He has given up on getting his brother back.</p>
<p>“His mind is completely closed,” he said.</p>
<p>The brothers have always disagreed on politics, but in recent months every exchange they had turned into a vicious fight. “I live on planet Earth and you live on planet Q,” Richard emailed Mark in October. “I don’t know if we can ever have a civil or intelligent conversation again.”</p>
<p>“You have treated me as a stupid little brother all your life, and I looked up to you as a mentor,” Mark wrote in one of the emails. In another, he wrote, “You have joined the sheep.”</p>
<br />
<p>The way Richard describes his brother, Mark fits the profile of what psychologists call an “injustice collector,” a<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jopy.12588" target="_blank"> personality type</a> considered likely to fall for conspiratorial thinking. Injustice collectors are overly confident, impulsive and eager to expose the naivete of people around them. Mark, Richard told me, always needed to have some piece of information, a secret that he could use to prove that he knew more than his older brother. Richard was considered the smart one in the family—he had good grades and loved books. Mark, on the other hand, hated reading and struggled at school due to undiagnosed dyslexia. For a while, he wrote his name backward, which earned him the nickname “Imkram,” for the way he wrote, “I’m Mark.” </p>
<p>Richard never gave much thought to his brother’s desire to prove himself smarter, but he knew that Mark loved secrets. In the early 2000s, they both joined a Masonic lodge. Richard found it underwhelming, while Mark stayed for years and climbed the ladder by memorizing the required information. Still, Richard was surprised when last year Mark handed him <i>QAnon: An Invitation to Great Awakening</i>, a book that briefly became second on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/6/18253505/amazon-qanon-book-best-seller-algorithm-conspiracy" target="_blank">the </a><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/6/18253505/amazon-qanon-book-best-seller-algorithm-conspiracy" target="_blank">Amazon bestseller list</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>“Mark, this is just nuts,” said Richard returning the book.</p>
<p>QAnon crept into the emails between the brothers, leading to heated arguments supported by links, bullet points and spiteful comments. After a while, it became clear that neither of them could move past political differences or change each other's mind. They have all but stopped emailing and calling.</p>
<p>On the day of the Capitol insurrection, Richard emailed Mark to say that he was happy his brother wasn’t there. Mark never responded or acknowledged the events when they saw each other a week later.</p>
<p>“If he hadn't been taking care of mom, he might have been one of the rioters,” said Richard. “That’s the way he thinks. He’s a very angry person.”</p>
<br />
<p>Anger shows up time and again on r/QanonCasualties. So does interest in secrets. </p>
<p>Some humans are more drawn to conspiratorial thinking than others, says Dr. Joseph Pierre, a professor of psychiatry at UCLA who writes extensively<b> </b>about QAnon on his “Psyche Unseen” blog on Psychology Today. Those who have a high level of mistrust of authoritative sources of information are more susceptible, for example. So are those who crave uniqueness and certainty, closure and control.</p>
<p>And Covid-19 is an added factor. “Times of crisis such as the current pandemic tend to increase belief in conspiracy theories as a way of coping with fear, uncertainty, and lack of control and as an expression of mistrust in authoritative sources of information,” said Pierre. People who don’t trust institutions, feel anxious over their future and have more time to spend online due to the stay-home order, may find that conspiracy theories can fill the void and soothe them. Once sucked into the dark sands of QAnon, they can develop an addiction-like compulsive behavior as they indulge in hours of “research.”</p>
<p>“When people go ‘down the rabbit hole’ and cut themselves off from previous relationships in favor of a new online community, they can be seen as ‘becoming a different person,’” said Pierre. </p>

<br />
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;">Emily dreams about Peter returning</span> from his QAnon unreality, and then finds herself watching, helpless, as he doubles down on his beliefs. When Trump lost the election—something that was never supposed to happen, according to QAnon—Peter tried to prove fraud. When rioters attacked the Capitol, Peter was upset they didn’t succeed in overthrowing Biden’s win. He called senators, withdrew cash from the bank and talked about buying guns in preparation for martial law.</p>
<p>“Considering his viewpoints and the way he’s been talking about it, I could see him as one of those people trying to storm the Capitol. If he was in D.C., he probably would have been in there with them,” said Emily. Knowing that scares her.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m sticking around and doing everything I can do, trying to wait for somebody to come back to me. And I don’t know if they ever will,” Emily said, sobbing. “I keep waiting for my husband to come back but maybe this guy doesn’t exist anymore.”</p>
<br />
<p>She hasn’t posted on r/QanonCasualties since October, but she still checks the forum and clings to the stories she reads there about someone quitting QAnon. She hopes that it could be Peter one day. “Maybe I’m an eternal optimist,” she said. “I just love him so much.”</p>
<p>They go to couples therapy, but it hasn’t helped much. So she finds solace where she can, like in the knowledge that some of their friends and family members find his beliefs as crazy as she does. But she also knows her limits, and has an exit plan in case things deteriorate further: “I’m a smart enough person to know that it can’t continue to go on like this,” she said.</p>

<br />
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi this week promised an “independent 9/11-type Commission” to find the truth behind the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of former President Donald Trump, wants a “9/11 Commission”; so does Sen. Bill Cassidy, one of the seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in his most recent impeachment trial.</p>
<p>As America looks for answers about a national crisis, the 9/11 Commission is widely seen as a high water mark. Its examination into the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, was authoritative and engrossing—the rare government report to make it onto bestseller lists—and nearly all of its proposed reforms were signed into law. </p>
<p>But for anyone expecting that Washington could spin up another version in 2021, Tim Roemer, a former congressman from Indiana who sat on the 9/11 Commission, has a word of caution.</p>
<p>“Most commissions don’t succeed,” he warns. “Most of them fail, and their recommendations are not passed or considered—they go up to sit on the top shelf of a bureaucrat’s dusty office, ignored into eternity.”</p>
<p>The 9/11 Commission stood apart, he says, because of its culture of bipartisanship, respect and clear-eyed approach to the facts at hand. It convened at a moment Congress shared a strong sense of purpose to fight the external threat—an atmosphere “conducive to exchange and debate, not sound bites and tweets.”</p>
<p>Today, things are different: The attack is already seen through partisan filters, and any new commission would be meeting in a Washington where disruption itself is a political brand. “If any one of these people appointed to the 9/11 Commission were bomb throwers or people who just wanted to disrupt the process, that by itself could easily have derailed the entire process,” says Roemer. “It only takes one member to do that.”</p>
<p>For all that, Roemer absolutely believes a new commission is necessary—and in the long run, could be more important than the one he sat on, perhaps “the most important commission ever.” He suggests a broad scope, looking not only at the January 6 attacks, but “how we try to ensure the peaceful transfer of power, what do we do to make sure that conspiracy theories and lies don’t permeate our democratic system of information getting to people, and how we take bipartisan steps forward to strengthen our democratic institutions.”</p>
<p>What can a 1/6 Commission learn from the 9/11 Commission? Is it possible to have a broadly accepted bipartisan consensus about the facts of the case? And can political allies of President Donald Trump be relied upon to participate in good faith?</p>
<p>To sort through it all, POLITICO Magazine spoke with Roemer this week. A condensed transcript of that conversation follows, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><b>Before serving on the 9/11 Commission, you were a member of the House for 12 years. You know the Capitol well. What was your reaction when you saw the insurrection last month? </b></p>
<p>In my public service journey, I’ve had three searing events that scorched my soul. </p>
<p>The first was as a fifth-grader: After having stayed up all night to cheer on my hero, Bobby Kennedy, in the California [1968 presidential] primary, my parents woke me up the next morning to tell me that he had been assassinated. </p>
<p>Second, was as a member of Congress: I was on Capitol Hill in a meeting with several members—including Nancy Pelosi—talking about a leadership race when the first plane went into the [World Trade Center], and we eventually had to scatter out of our office buildings into the streets, where our cellphones didn’t work; we later learned that the Capitol was a target. </p>
<p>The third was January 6. I was riveted to the TV, watching insurrectionists and terrorists ravage our citadel of democracy and threaten custodians, staff members, members of the House and Senate, as well as the vice president of United States—threaten to assassinate them. This was Americans attacking our own family.</p>
<p><b>That’s a big difference: The insurrection was an attack <i>by </i>Americans—one inherently tied up in partisan politics—and there isn’t anything similar to the post-9/11 sense of bipartisan unity. Do you think that changes the way that a 9/11 Commission-style investigation into the insurrection would work? How should it approach its mission?</b></p>
<p>There are many similarities between 9/11 and the January 6 domestic terrorist attack on the United States. There are myriad differences as well, and it’s vital to distinguish between the two. </p>
<p>One of the similarities is that both were extremely violent, in some ways unexpected, planned physical attacks on our government institutions. On 9/11, it was Wall Street, the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol, though [United Flight 93] was brought down by brave patriots in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, before it could hit its target in Washington; January 6 targeted the Capitol. The number of law enforcement casualties on 9/11 was one of the highest in our country’s history; January 6 caused horrific and catastrophic damage to our law enforcement community. </p>
<p>This question about a January 6 commission’s remit and mission is an essential one, and something I’ve tried to express to the Speaker [Nancy Pelosi], the speaker’s staff and people interested in this [commission] legislation: We need to get to the bottom of the events of January 6. How was it planned? How was it carried out? Why did intelligence miss it, or why wasn’t intelligence reported? What did law enforcement miss? Was there a role—and what was the role of President Donald Trump or members of Congress? What were the roles of social media, of disinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories leading up to it, planning it, sharing it and inspiring people to be involved? </p>
<br />
<p>[A commission] needs to look at the role of white supremacist organizations, their growth, their spread, their utilization of social media and the Internet. How did they become part of this effort? How did they get such a foothold? Do they continue to pose, as the FBI director has said, one of the great internal threats to the United States? What should we do about this? </p>
<p>There are also questions about not only how to protect Congress, but how to strengthen the <i>institution </i>of Congress. That could be one of the grand and most fulfilling things that this commission could do: What is the constitutional role of Congress, and how does it reconnect with the American people to reestablish that trust?</p>
<p>This commission should not just serve up its recommendations, findings and conclusions for Congress. For this commission to be successful in the long term, it needs to connect to the American people and communicate with them, to help inform them about its findings and why it matters. Most commissions don’t succeed. Most of them fail, and their recommendations are not passed or considered—they go up to sit on the top shelf of a bureaucrat’s dusty office, ignored into eternity. </p>
<p><b>The 9/11 Commission was different in that sense—its report was widely respected and something of a sensation. What made the 9/11 Commission different? Why was it a success? </b></p>
<p>I’ve reflected on this over the years. Some of it was strategy, some was pre-planning, some was pure luck. </p>
<p>We made mistakes. [As a member of the House,] I drafted the legislation to create the 9/11 Commission. I will be the first to admit that one of the mistakes I made initially was not adequately funding the commission. It had to come back to Congress several times, asking for more money, tin cup in hand. An independent commission should not have to come back to a funding body, thereby potentially jeopardizing its independence. </p>
<p>We did a lot right. </p>
<p>We insisted that all our press conferences and press appearances be bipartisan. [Former New Jersey Republican Gov.] Tom Kean and [former Democratic Congressman] Lee Hamilton, the commission’s chair and the vice chair, respectively, led by example: They were always joined at the hip to do press conferences. It created a culture on the commission of respect for one another. We could listen to one another’s views, occasionally change one’s mind based on the facts and the presentation of the facts, and, at the end of the day, get to principled outcomes and recommendations. The culture was conducive to exchange and debate, not sound bites and tweets. </p>
<p>At one of our first meetings, we had a long conversation about strategy and putting a tail on the commission’s life so that we would be available for six months or a year to testify and try to get our recommendations into law. Most commissions failed because their recommendations sit idly by and nobody is there to see that they are passed. Out of our 41 recommendations, I believe 39&frac12; were passed into law. I believe that is unprecedented in these commissions’ histories. </p>
<br />
<p>Another factor in our success was the 9/11 families. They are extraordinary. I have four children. If I were to lose one of my kids to a terrorist attack, I’m not sure I could function. These people plowed in and passionately devoted themselves full time to this. They were available 24 hours a day. They’d do op-eds. They’d fly or take trains down from New York or New Jersey on a moment’s notice to lobby the White House or meet with members of Congress. They were the moral suasion to keep pushing for change and get our recommendations passed into law. Without them, we wouldn’t succeed—plain and simple. </p>
<p>And finally, I wrote the initial legislation so that the president would appoint the chair of the commission, and leadership in the Congress would appoint the remaining members. The speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader and the [House and Senate] minority leaders all took those responsibilities very seriously and appointed people with deep experience in law enforcement, national security and, more importantly, people who had worked across the aisle in serious and productive ways—who had established relationships of trust and would put country before party. If any one of these people appointed to the 9/11 Commission were bomb throwers or people who just wanted to disrupt the process, that by itself could easily have derailed the entire process. It only takes one member to do that. </p>
<p>And then we got lucky. We got a little lagniappe, as my wife, who’s from Louisiana, likes to say—a little extra: Our report turned into a best-selling book. I remember recommending that we shift one of the chapters—“We Have Some Planes”—to the beginning [thinking] that we could capture people’s attention as to what exactly transpired on September 11. Americans needed to be taken through that plot and understand that our entire national security system had to be revised and reformed to make our country safer. And once the American people understand and buy into a concept and support it, then Congress and the president could eventually sign on and help us pass the recommendations. </p>
<p><b>That culture within the 9/11 Commission—that sense of bipartisan comity—feels quite different from politics today, which are very partisan. In this climate, do you think we can actually have a nonpartisan 1/6 Commission and report? </b></p>
<p>Maybe it’s more important today <i>because</i> we are so divided. We are so poisoned with toxicity and social media dividing us deeply. Maybe we need a commission that works in a bipartisan way to show the path forward to Americans—that we have done this before and can do this now. </p>
<p>Twenty years ago, I felt the claws of history 2 inches into my back over what had happened. I felt the lift of patriotism and country over party. Today, I have the same feeling. </p>
<br />
<p>I remember the days when we worked on <i>bipartisan</i> legislation on national security and intelligence policy—always [bipartisan]. Those days were not that long ago. We can get back there, but the American people need an example like this January 6 commission to show that, yes, Republicans and Democrats can sit around and respect each other again. We can get to the bottom of what happened to tear our country apart. We can come up with recommendations to fix things. </p>
<p><b>That sounds pretty optimistic to me. There are already Republicans who disagree about the basic facts of the insurrection. You saw an attorney for President Trump <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/feb/12/michael-van-der-veen/trump-impeachment-defense-lawyer-wrongly-singles-o/" target="_blank">falsely claim</a> that a “leader of Antifa” was one of the first people arrested in the insurrection. Sen. Ron Johnson <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/sen-ron-johnson-this-didn-t-seem-like-an-armed-insurrection-to-me/article_5c7211fb-6909-51ce-810b-c6b57b658f56.html" target="_blank">said this week</a> that contrary to the evidence, January 6 “didn’t seem like an armed insurrection.” A number of Trump allies have said similar things. </b></p>
<p><b>If the goal of the commission is partly to provide some sense of clarity about what happened—and to do so in a bipartisan way—then it seems potentially important that people of Trump’s political persuasion take part in the commission. But if the focus of the commission is to decide the <i>facts</i> of what happened, how does that work? Could Trump allies actually take part in that commission in good faith? Would its report still have credibility?</b></p>
<p>Well, this is where the commission needs to be resolute, absolutely clear and fiercely factual.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of 9/11, there was such unity and coming together across America. People came forward to give blood, fly their flags and show how much they love our country. There was virtually no disagreement [about the facts]—maybe it was way in the background, with less than 1 percent of the American people promoting crazy conspiracy theories. </p>
<p>But I remember years later, after the 9/11 Commission, being on a radio or TV interview, and somebody would say, “George W. Bush attacked the World Trade Center buildings on September 11.” And I would say very clearly, “You are absolutely wrong. I’m a Democrat. I have a different point of view from George W. Bush on many, many things. But you are so far off-base, and I’m not going to say anything to you other than that you are 110 percent wrong.”</p>
<br />
<p>We have to put that kind of thing to bed. We have to make sure we confront these lies and conspiracy theories and disinformation—whether it’s about 9/11 or January 6. But it’s getting more and more difficult. </p>
<p>One of the remits of this January 6 Commission should be to look at the role of disinformation, social media, lies and conspiracies in feeding this attack and brutal desecration of our Capitol. We can’t allow those things to continue to spread. What do we do about that in social media? Is that [about] Section 230? Is that regulation? Is that self-regulation by the companies? A democracy cannot sustain those kinds of lies and facts being distorted and the erosion of truth in our society. </p>
<p><b>It sounds like you see a January 6 Commission as an opportunity on the part of Republican leadership put those conspiracy theorists to bed?</b></p>
<p>Fom what I’ve read of Senator [Mitch] McConnell’s comments, this would be an opportunity for him to appoint people to the commission who would confront some of the lies and conspiracies and misinformation that has floated around for months and may have contributed to this. </p>
<p>Senator McConnell’s floor speech the other day certainly leads people to believe that he shares the frustration with the spread of these conspiracy theories, and has deep concern about the need to strengthen the role of Congress as an institution and critical democratic participant moving forward. </p>
<p><b>Final question: The last 20 years of politics have, to varying degrees, been in the shadow of 9/11. So much of what we experienced traces back to that moment in some way. Now, 20 years later, do you see January 6 as the start of another era? </b></p>
<p>Well, if you thought one of my previous answers was looking at the glass half full, maybe this will be looking at the glass 90 percent full. </p>
<p>I think that America, having gone through the last 10 or 15 years, is due for a reemergence of our pride in our democracy. It’s going to take a full-out effort on the part of not just the commission, but the American people, the press, constituent groups, of civic education and national service to do this. </p>
<br />
<p>It’s almost as if we need a new Alexis de Tocqueville in 2021. He wrote “Democracy in America” back in 1832, and came up with all these marvelous insights about how unique our system was. One of the big challenges, he said, was that America had to have its best people serve, and had to continue to attract the brightest and most principled into the public square—and he was not sure they could do that over time. When we look back at the kind of people who have helped build this country—whether it’s Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., or Rosa Parks, or people in the suffragist movement, Susan B. Anthony, or fighters for our Union in the Civil War, or going back to the unique set of actors who wrote the Constitution and Declaration of Independence—we’ve had those people step forward and serve in times of really difficult decisions and division. </p>
<p>That’s one of the roles that this January 6 commission could potentially serve. Its remit and mission should be to not only look at the attacks on January 6 and what caused them and the facts behind them; it should include [issues like] how we try to ensure the peaceful transfer of power, what do we do to make sure that conspiracy theories and lies don’t permeate our democratic system of information getting to people, and how we take bipartisan steps forward to strengthen our democratic institutions. </p>
<p>If we can do that, this could be, in many ways, one of the most important commissions, if not the most important commission ever, because it’s dealing with our representative democracy. Lincoln asked whether this nation, this democracy, will endure. That’s the question.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Rocket attacks on an American base in Iraq by an Iran-backed militia will require a clear response. Nuclear negotiations, not to mention the safety of U.S. troops, depend on it.</description>

<br />
<p>Joe Biden is squarely in the middle of a major foreign policy test as president, and while it has gone largely unremarked inside the U.S., the Middle East is watching closely to see how he responds to an attack on U.S. forces.</p>
<p>Monday night, as many as 24 rockets were fired at a U.S. military base at Erbil International Airport, in the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The attacked, almost certainly launched by an Iran-backed militia, wounded an American soldier, killed one non-U.S. contractor and wounded five others. Three local civilians were also wounded.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, I <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/02/why-an-iran-attack-could-be-bidens-hour-one-crisis-453477" target="_blank">argued</a> that a new President Biden might face just such a challenge early in his administration. Iran wanted to avenge the assassination of Qassem Soleimani in early January 2020 but I suggested that rather than provoking an outgoing Donald Trump, that it might choose instead to put his replacement to the test by waiting until after Inauguration Day. That is exactly what happened and now the question is how Biden will respond.</p>
<p>The early answer is: cautiously. On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki stated that the U.S. reserves “the right to respond at a time and manner of our choosing but we’ll wait for the attribution to be concluded first.”</p>
<p>Establishing culpability is important, to be sure, but that won’t take long. In fact, intelligence experts already have a very good idea where blame lies. The most pressing concern is to communicate clearly to Iran what the consequences will be for encouraging further attacks.</p>
<p>It is a miracle that a lot more people were not killed. Two of the two dozen rockets struck the camp of the U.S.-led coalition. If more had struck the U.S. base, the result might have been multiple U.S. fatalities, as was the case on March 11, 2020, when another rocket attack killed two U.S. personnel and also one British servicewoman in Iraq.</p>
<p>Most of the rockets fired on February 15 missed the airport and struck the densely populated city, crowded with Kurds, Arab displaced persons, Western diplomats and foreign workers. Civilian homes and apartment complexes were struck. If even one rocket had struck a high-rise, in a city with limited firefighting capacity, the death toll could have been catastrophic.</p>
<p>In late 2019, the same winding-up of militia attacks led to the end-of-year tit-for-tat strikes in Iraq in which a U.S. contactor was killed, the U.S. embassy was besieged, thousands of U.S. troops were flown to Iraq. America killed over thirty Iran-backed militiamen and Iran’s senior general and spymaster, Qassem Soleimani. Iran fired ballistic missiles at a U.S. base, injuring over a hundred U.S. troops.</p>
<p>That episode warns that, unless countered, the Erbil attack will not mark the end of militia provocations against the Biden administration but rather the beginning. This dynamic has to be quickly reversed before Americans are killed and maimed, before the U.S. is drawn into retaliatory actions, or before U.S. credibility takes a new hit in the eyes of our allies and partners in the region.</p>
<p>As Psaki noted Tuesday, ensuring a correct attribution of blame must be the starting point, and it offers a welcome excuse for the Biden team to slow down the process, take a breath, and review options. As someone who has been at the heart of dozens of similar intelligence exercises, I know it is not difficult to tell who did the attack: Many factors suggest with high confidence that it was Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq (AAH), a U.S.-designated terrorist group with gallons of U.S. blood on its hands from the years before the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq in 2011.</p>
<p>Let’s review the circumstantial evidence available even to a trained observer who only has access to media, social media and some insiders. An AAH-run media front called Ashab al-Kahf (Companions of the Cave) spent much of February 15 criticizing the Kurdistan Region, and then (13 minutes before the rocket attack) issued a cryptic Telegram message threatening Kurdistan and Erbil. In the hours after the attack, AAH’s Telegram channel, Sabareen, dominated coverage of the incident, with other groups getting access to information slower than the AAH channel.</p>
<p>When a claim emerged, and was not disputed by other militia groups, it came from Saraya Alwiya al-Dam (Custodians of the Blood), which is another media brand that AAH occasionally uses to claim attacks. To add to this picture, similar circumstantial evidence has identified AAH as the militia that rocketed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad on November 20 and December 25, and which undertook the last attack on U.S. targets in Erbil on September 30.</p>
<p>For those inside the system, with top secret access to eavesdropping intelligence, the trail of breadcrumbs leading to AAH will quickly become even clearer. Whether they choose to let the outside world know of this evidence is another matter.</p>
<p>Such evidence will also give a sense whether Iran commissioned the attack, or was unaware of it, or simply didn’t care. In the case of AAH, the group has a habit of attacking Americans in order to boost its own prestige, without needing an explicit go-ahead from Tehran. But even if the Erbil attack was not intended by Tehran as a trial of Biden’s credibility, it has immediately become that test.</p>
<p>Based on my close focus on AAH and other Iraqi militias, I rather doubt Iran was the driving force behind the Erbil attack, but I know for sure that Iran <i>could</i> warn the group away from future outrages of this kind, if Tehran were properly motivated.</p>
<p>The Biden team is looking for a diplomatic first step, as opposed to immediate recourse to military strikes or new sanctions. A smart move would be to directly warn Tehran that the U.S. expects Iran to restrain all its proxies from taking destabilizing moves such as the Erbil attack or the January 23 <a href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/drones-over-riyadh-unpacking-iran-threat-networks-tactics" target="_blank">drone attack</a> on the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, which was also launched from Iraq. Such a message would alert the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) that America is not fooled by facades, but rather remains clear-eyed about Tehran’s influence over anti-American militias.</p>
<p>In particular, the Biden team should publicly warn<b> </b>Iran that if another American is killed or wounded in Iraq or elsewhere in the Gulf, then the Biden administration will suspend efforts to restart nuclear negotiations. Only a firm and clear line will safeguard U.S. soldiers operating on the frontlines of the war against the Islamic State or those protecting U.S. interests across the Middle East. An assessment period might be set during which Iran would be given time to quietly de-escalate the activities of its militia partners in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.</p>
<p>It might seem counterintuitive to address the militia threat ahead of the more consequential effort to stop Iran getting a bomb, but how can a U.S. president sit down and negotiate with an Iranian government that is either tacitly or actively encouraging attempts to kill Americans?</p>
<p>Better, surely, to privately condition new talks with Iran on a visible quieting-down of Iran-backed militias in the Middle East – a non-lethal, diplomatic first step to safeguard Americans and U.S. partners across the region.</p>
<p>If Iran fails to restrain its proxies, then the Biden administration should not shy away from a demonstration of force that is credible and measured. Very clearly, as demonstrated by the Erbil strike, the Iran-backed militias do not fear or respect the Biden administration in the same manner that they did the Trump administration. This is a dangerous state of affairs that could lead to miscalculation and the deaths of Americans.</p>
<p>To restore deterrence, the U.S. should consider options to shake the confidence of the AAH leadership, such as a “near-miss” drone or covert action strike on a location close to its head, Qais al-Khazali, or an obvious penetration of his personal communications and computer security. If the Biden team wants to differentiate their approach from the past administration, then such “out of the box” thinking is more needed than ever.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>For 25 of the past 30 years, no public figure more fully represented the aggrieved soul of the American Right than Rush Limbaugh. </p>
<p>These past five years, of course, Limbaugh was superseded in that claim by Donald Trump. Even then, it is impossible to conceive of Trump’s path to power if it had not been over ground tilled by Limbaugh.</p>
<p>The radio host, who died Wednesday of lung cancer, showed how to merge the raucous sensibility of a natural entertainer with keen intuition about the everyday political and cultural resentments nurtured by millions of Americans and spin it all into a lucrative mass movement. </p>
<p>Marc Antony came to bury Caesar, not to praise him, but in Limbaugh’s case it is fitting to do some of both. </p>
<p>Praise, of a sort: He was a brilliant performer, a self-invented character who, reading not very far through the lines of interviews over the years, had the interior life of a lonely misfit who came alive and found adoration mainly in front of the microphone. Here, in this florid exterior life, he used bombast, humor, insult, indignation, malice, superb timing and an astonishingly facile mind to make himself very famous, very rich and very influential. Limbaugh was wooed by presidents if they were Republicans, castigated by them if Democrats. In both cases they often seemed intimidated by him.</p>
<p>But the burial part is more important. At the age of 70 when he died, Limbaugh lived long enough to see where his brand of commercialized contempt — once it moved from the margins to the center of U.S political culture — would lead. It leads to a rancid, cheerless place, one quite different than anything Limbaugh himself talked about in earlier phases of his career when he rhapsodized about his notions of the ideal America.</p>
<p>There is no more pressing task, for either the conservative or progressive movements, than to endeavor that Limbaugh and the style of politics he represented will soon be seen as artifacts of a receding age, rather than forerunners of the next one.</p>
<p>What does that latter alternative look like? Well, Limbaugh himself described it in December, not long before his last show, when he told a caller that the United States was “trending toward secession.” Yes, seriously, as in during the Civil War. &quot;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/529609-rush-limbaugh-says-us-trending-toward-seccession" target="_blank">It can’t go on this way,&quot;</a> he said, not quite a month before the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. &quot;There cannot be a peaceful coexistence of two completely different theories of life, theories of government, theories of how we manage our affairs. We can’t be in this dire a conflict without something giving somewhere along the way.&quot; After an uproar, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/rush-limbaugh-trump-secession-election/2020/12/10/8889397a-3b0d-11eb-bc68-96af0daae728_story.html" target="_blank">Limbaugh clarified</a> that this was not what he wished for, only how he heard people talking.</p>
<p>But the comment highlighted several of the contradictions that defined Limbaugh’s career and still trap the conservative movement now, as Republicans ponder that they have won a popular majority in only one presidential election in the eight since the host first vaulted onto a national stage in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The first paradox relates to the GOP’s 40-year journey from Ronald Reagan to Trump. Limbaugh often professed his adulation of Reagan, who had just left office as the younger man’s career began to climb. By the end of that career, Limbaugh was a Trump partisan, and at the time his cancer diagnosis became public was rewarded for his loyalty with a State of the Union address tribute and a Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p>
<p>How is the genial courtesy of Reagan and his sunny-side-up approach to public life connected to the rudeness and self-absorption of Trump and his grievance-uber-alles politics?</p>
<p>For most of his career, Limbaugh professed to be a traditional conservative who liked small government, low taxes, strong defense, free trade and respect for the Constitution. Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Committee in 2009, he said conservatives want these things, and also to be left alone from the hypocritical, bossy do-goodism of liberals. When conservatives look at the country, he said, “We see Americans. We see human beings. We don’t see groups. We don’t see victims.”</p>
<p>How does this square with a politician like Trump, who distrusts free trade, didn’t blink at massive deficits, said a U.S. federal judge couldn’t rule fairly on immigration cases because he was of Mexican heritage and encouraged the belief that an election overseen by states and ruled legitimate by courts was “stolen” because he lost it.</p>
<p>Especially early in his career, he had a familiar response when people tried to grill him on matters of fairness or consistency. He was a performer, not a politician or a journalist. “I look at this as entertainment,” <a href="http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,979470-4,00.html" target="_blank">he told a Time magazine cover writer</a> in 1993. He could be intermittently responsive on email. Once, when I emailed him about an on-air riff concerning me that I thought was unfair, he emailed back in friendly fashion suggesting, in advice I took, that I should not take things so seriously and go with the flow.</p>
<p>When it suited him, however, he could also take himself and his own views quite seriously, as when he told a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/magazine/06Limbaugh-t.html" target="_blank">writer for the <i>New York Times</i></a>: “I want to persuade people with ideas. I don’t walk around thinking about my power. But in my heart and soul, I know I have become the intellectual engine of the conservative movement.”</p>
<p>Here is another contradiction. For all that a generation of conservatives boasted that they were animated by ideas — unlike liberals, who are supposedly animated by special interests and identity politics — Limbaugh and Trump represented a psychological movement more than an ideological one. It is unified by shared dislikes — of the media, of civil rights activists, of know-it-all professors, of feminists, of preening, hypocritical liberal politicians, of anyone who, they perceive, assumes a pose of moral superiority toward the cultural attitudes and lifestyle of traditional middle Americans.</p>
<p>Viewed through this prism, there is much more continuity than drift in Limbaugh’s political profile over the years, even if he drifted from Reagan Republican to Trump Republican. From his early days upon going into national syndication, he referred to “feminazis.” In 1990, for a while he had a regular shtick in which he would introduce <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/clip/71309533/the-gazette/" target="_blank">homophobic updates about the AIDS virus by playing songs</a> such as, “Back in the Saddle,” “Kiss Him Goodbye,” and, “Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.” He later said he regretted mocking people who died painful deaths. But it’s also clear his mockery in 2012 of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh%E2%80%93Sandra_Fluke_controversy" target="_blank">Georgetown University student Sandra Fluke</a> as “a slut,” after she testified to Congress in favor of coverage of birth control as a health care benefit, was not in the least an anomaly. </p>
<p>One last contradiction: Limbaugh in his own life hardly represented the kind of traditional values he extolled. He was married three times and arrested for misusing prescription painkillers, to which he acknowledged he was addicted. Nor in interviews did he present a picture of someone who regarded himself as one of life’s natural winners. His father was austere and strict, and wanted him to be an academic standout, but instead he dropped out of college after a year. After his syndicated radio show became a hit, he expected to be embraced in elite New York media circles by the likes of Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather. “Look, I admired these people,” he told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/magazine/06Limbaugh-t.html" target="_blank">the <i>Times</i></a>, “I thought they would welcome me as one of them. I was wrong.”</p>
<p>Much of Limbaugh’s performance was entertaining bluster, and, if one happened to catch it in the right mood, it was made more enjoyable by the impression that he was enjoying it as much as anyone. But the core of resentment was real — as corrosive for Limbaugh personally as it is for the political culture over which he loomed so large for so long.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>Perched on a cream-colored armchair,<b> </b>Johnny Enlow, a 61-year-old, California-based Pentecostal pastor with short-cropped gray hair, a trim beard and Tom Selleck-style mustache, looked into the camera and prophesied that Donald Trump would become president again.</p>
<p>Not in 2024. In 2021.</p>
<p>“The January 20 inauguration date doesn’t really mean anything,” Enlow said in the January 29 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNL2KWuLOIE&amp;t=251s" target="_blank">video</a>, which has gotten north of 100,000 views on YouTube. According to Enlow, more than 100 other “credible” Christian prophets around the world had likewise declared that Trump, somehow, would be restored to power soon. </p>
<p>Indeed, Enlow was not alone out on that limb. Greg Locke, a Nashville pastor with a massive social media following, <a href="https://youtu.be/oec1abJ2ABg" target="_blank">said</a> after Trump’s loss that he would “100 percent remain president of the United States for another term.” Kat Kerr, a pink-haired preacher from Jacksonville, Florida, declared repeatedly last month that Trump had won the election “by a landslide” and that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8BNNTueyN8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">God had told her</a> he would serve for eight years. In his video, Enlow went further. “There’s not going to be just Trump coming back,” he said. “There’s going to be at least two more Trumps that will be in office in some way.” Donald Trump, he <a href="https://friendlyatheist.patheos.com/2021/01/28/lying-preacher-heaven-says-trump-is-the-government-leader-on-planet-earth/" target="_blank">proclaimed</a> elsewhere, was “the primary government leader on Planet Earth.”</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/b3/72/91ceb5fc45069a2f5ec46eb3c3f9/enlowlockekerr.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Enlow, Locke and Kerr are among dozens of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/christian-prophets-predictions.html" target="_blank">Christian prophets</a> in America—religious leaders with followings among Pentecostal and charismatic Christians who claim<b> </b>the ability to predict the future based on dreams, visions and other supernatural phenomena. Some prophets are church leaders, while others operate independently. There are no official requirements for prophet status, though followers generally expect prophets to<b> </b>get at least a few prophecies right.</p>
<p>But, lately, that standard has come under duress—particularly when it comes to Donald Trump.</p>
<p>In 2015, spurred by the lengthy prophecy of a 27-year-old wunderkind named Jeremiah Johnson, many Pentecostals and charismatics embraced the idea that God had chosen Trump to restore America’s Christian moorings. Trump’s surprise win in 2016 offered a dramatic validation, and in 2020 dozens of prophets declared that he would win election again. This time, they were wrong. Yet, in the wake of Joe Biden’s victory, instead of apologizing or backtracking, a number of prophets continue to assert that it is God’s will for Trump to be in the White House and that a miraculous reversal is nigh. Enlow, who did not respond to<b> </b>a request for comment for this article, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=733416153962421&amp;ref=watch_permalink" target="_blank">has said</a> Trump’s victory will be made clear by March. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/tracking-voter-trust-in-elections/" target="_blank">only two-thirds</a> of voters—and one-third of Republicans—expressing confidence that Biden won a free and fair election, many observers worry that these prophets are sowing more confusion, blurring the line between misinformation and religious proclamation. They are spreading their message to wide audiences—some preachers who amplify these prophecies have followings in the millions—that<b> </b>increasingly exist in an echo chamber of like-minded religious YouTube channels, Instagram feeds and websites such as ElijahList, host of the YouTube channel ElijahStreams, where Enlow’s video aired. </p>
<p>It’s well known that Trump received strong support from white evangelicals in the 2020 election; estimates hover around <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/324410/religious-group-voting-2020-election.aspx" target="_blank">80 percent</a>. But the role that prophecy plays in that support might be underexplored. In a <a href="https://religioninpublic.blog/2020/05/11/trump-the-anointed/" target="_blank">survey conducted last year</a>, two political scientists found that nearly half of America’s church-attending white Protestants believed Trump was anointed by God to be president—a portion of the population that other scholars have dubbed “<a href="https://www.religionwatch.com/prophecy-voters-forming-core-of-trumps-evangelical-base/" target="_blank">prophecy voters</a>.”<b> </b>The share is likely higher among charismatic Christians, who <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/religious-family/pentecostal-family-evangelical-trad/party-affiliation/" target="_blank">skew more politically and theologically conservative</a><b> </b>than evangelicals as a whole. And although this population is only a subset of American Christianity, it’s a large one: Some estimates hold that as many as 65 million Americans could be counted as Pentecostals or charismatics.</p>
<p>Not all prophets have doubled down on their Trump prophecies since the election, however. And as some have backed away from Trump,<b> </b>a schism has emerged. At least six recognized prophets who initially predicted a Trump reelection have acknowledged those prophecies were wrong. They now say they are deeply troubled by their peers’ refusal to acknowledge the same—and worry that allegiance to Trump could threaten the prophetic tradition itself.</p>
<br />
<p>In a December 15 article, Michael Brown, a longtime charismatic revivalist and scholar in Charlotte, North Carolina, had sharp words, <a href="https://stream.org/to-my-prophetic-friends-you-were-either-right-or-you-were-wrong/" target="_blank">warning co-religionists</a>: “There is no reality in which Trump actually did win but in fact didn’t win. … To entertain possibilities like this is to mock the integrity of prophecy and to make us charismatics look like total fools.” After apologizing on January 7 for his own prophecy that Trump would be reelected, Jeremiah Johnson called parts of the prophetic movement “deeply sick.” In early February, he released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYCOAR2zuZ0" target="_blank">new YouTube series</a> called “I Was Wrong: Donald Trump and the Prophetic Controversy.” </p>
<p>“I believe that this election cycle has revealed how desperately we need reformation in the prophetic movement,” Johnson said in a February 8 video. “I have serious concerns for the charismatic-prophetic world that if we do not wake up, if we do not humble ourselves, there is greater judgment to come.”</p>
<p>The emerging rift mirrors the one in the GOP, with one faction trying to move on from Trump in the name of democratic principles, and the other redoubling their commitment to him, spurred by the grassroots and in defiance of facts. Johnson and other prophets in his camp have received fervent pushback from their followers. But Brown and his ilk believe a reckoning is in order—that false prophets must be held accountable and that reforms are needed if the prophecy movement is to retain any spiritual integrity. He has begun convening monthly Zoom calls with prophetic leaders to discuss a way forward. </p>
<p>“This has opened the door to outright delusion,” Brown said in an interview. “As a full-blooded charismatic, I’ll say we’ve earned the world’s mockery for our foolishness.”</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;"><b>Although common in biblical times,</b></span> Christian prophecy largely fell into disuse<b> </b>for almost two millennia. It has a scriptural tradition: In his first letter to the Corinthians, the Apostle Paul describes prophecy as one of the Holy Spirit’s gifts for believers. The contemporary version was revived, along with the better-known gifts of healing and speaking in tongues, at a Pentecostal prayer meeting in Topeka, Kansas, in 1901. Over time, the Pentecostal movement—joined in the 1960s by like-minded followers in mainline Protestant and Catholic circles known as “charismatics”—has become the world’s fastest-growing form of Christianity, with an estimated <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2011/12/19/global-christianity-movements-and-denominations/" target="_blank">half a billion</a> believers around the globe.</p>
<p>Pentecostal worship tends to be more decentralized than the more formal mainline denominations, and many charismatic churches are completely independent. In the late 1980s, when the “Kansas City prophets,” a group of Pentecostal-charismatic leaders based in the Missouri suburbs, came out with controversial claims of supernatural visions and prophecies of future events—like a billion people becoming Christian almost overnight and hospitals being emptied of their sick patients—there was no governing body to rein them in. Concerns about accountability led to the formation in 1999 of the <a href="https://godencounters.com/tag/apostolic-council-of-prophetic-elders/" target="_blank">Apostolic Council of Prophetic Elders</a>, a group of about 32 people tasked with quality control. </p>
<p>But many of the prophetic voices that emerged after the creation of the ACPE formed their own ministries and networks, and the council gradually lost influence. “The entire prophetic and prayer movement expanded with the digital age,” James Goll, a Nashville-based prophet who was part of the Kansas City group, said in an interview. “So, one might ask, is there accountability on these new platforms?”</p>

<br />
<p>Political prophecies are a relatively recent phenomenon. Televangelist Pat Robertson, who ran for president as a Republican in 1988, occasionally prophesied everything from wars to Earth-destroying asteroids, but it was Trump who gave the movement a political focal point. Trump is seen by some charismatic Christians as<b> </b>chosen by God in spite of his faults. Prophets have said as far back as 2007 that the then-real estate mogul would eventually land in the White House. In 2011, a retired Orlando firefighter-turned-prophet named Mark Taylor predicted Trump would be elected in 2012. (After Trump decided not to run, a few prophets <a href="https://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/prophets-forecasted-romney-victory-until-he-lost/" target="_blank">predicted</a>, incorrectly as it turned out, that Mitt Romney would win.)</p>
<p>Once Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, more prophets, led by Johnson, predicted his win. Published in <i>Charisma</i> magazine, Johnson’s July 2015, prophecy—that Trump would be a latter-day Cyrus, modeled after the 6th-century B.C. Persian king who allowed Babylonian Jews to return to their homeland—was heavily criticized by some evangelical leaders, who pointed out that Trump had never been known to be a serious Christian, and had a personal history of divorces and extramarital affairs. (Johnson himself wrote that Trump was “like a bull in a china shop” who would disturb some people’s “sense of peace and tranquility.”) Many evangelicals still preferred other Republican candidates. Yet Trump’s prophetic fan club did not budge. Taylor not only updated his original prophecy to say Trump would win in 2016, but also said Trump would appoint three Supreme Court justices, an outcome that seemed only a distant possibility back then.</p>
<p>After Trump’s unexpected victory against Hillary Clinton, the new president welcomed Christian leaders who had been early supporters into the halls of power. Kerr led <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC_eySMKVEM" target="_blank">a six-minute blessing</a> over Trump during his inaugural prayer breakfast in 2017. (She later prophesied that not only would Trump have two consecutive terms—so would former Vice President Mike Pence.) Most notable was Paula White-Cain, Trump’s spiritual adviser for more than a decade who recruited several Pentecostal leaders for his evangelical advisory board.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Trump’s wooing of evangelicals and charismatics made for “a veritable flood” of favorable prophecies during his presidency, in Brown’s words. They ranged from Australian prophet Lana Vawser’s <a href="https://lanavawser.com/2017/05/03/i-saw-the-lord-speak-to-president-trump-you-wont-believe-what-he-said/" target="_blank">May 2017 vision</a> of Jesus clothing Trump with a purple robe and crown, to Enlow’s <a href="https://www.elijahlist.com/words/display_word.html?ID=23195" target="_blank">February 2020 assertion</a> that the victory by the Kansas City Chiefs over the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl that year had prophetic significance for, among other things, the fact that “Trump is God-sent” and is advancing “a Kingdom agenda.” (Enlow is one of several prophets who believe God speaks through major sports events.)</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/gods-man-in-the-white-house-james-beverley/1136738302" target="_blank">2020 book</a>, James Beverley, a research professor at Tyndale University in Toronto, tracked more than 500 prophecies about Trump by more than 100 prophets over a 15-year period, and found a low batting average for accuracy. “My research,” Beverley told me, “shows that the prophecies are usually vague, sometimes totally wrong, and, with rare exception, have failed to be properly critical of Trump.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Trump rewarded his Pentecostal supporters with photo ops in the Oval Office and visits to their churches, including one this past October in Las Vegas, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb1x9Jx8IUM" target="_blank">where leaders prophesied</a>, to a cheering crowd, that Trump would win a second term. “The Lord spoke to me and said, ‘I am going to give your president a second wind,’” senior associate pastor Denise Goulet said as Trump, standing in the crowd, beamed and spread out his arms in an I-told-you-so gesture. </p>
<p>Some observers argue the prophecies at times were an attempt to curry favor with a powerful political figure and movement. “What were they getting in return?” asks Chris Rosebrough, a theologian and Lutheran pastor on the Minnesota-North Dakota state line who monitors prophets on his Pirate Christian Radio broadcasts. “They had direct access to him and ability to influence decisions Trump was making. The real story was in the power, influence and access.”</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;"><b>On November 7, the day Biden</b> <b>was declared the president-elect,</b></span> one prophet, Kris Vallotton, of the mega-congregation Bethel Church in Redding, California, notably apologized. “I take full responsibility for being wrong,” he said on Instagram. “There was no excuse for it. I think it doesn’t make me a false prophet, but it does actually create a credibility gap.”</p>
<p>But dozens of Pentecostal prophets dug in, insisting, even after the Electoral College vote certifying Biden’s win, that Trump would still be inaugurated.</p>
<br />
<p>In addition to Kerr, Enlow and Locke, there was South Carolina prophet Dutch Sheets, who announced a seven-state “prayer tour” to sites where the votes were being contested. “We believe we can win this battle,” he <a href="https://dutchsheets.org/" target="_blank">said</a>. Jeff Jansen, a Murfreesboro, Tennessee, prophet, appeared on ElijahStreams to echo Enlow’s prophecy of a Trump dynasty. “The last Trump will be Barron,” <a href="file:///Users/stephenheuser/Downloads/Do%20you%20have%20a%20link%3f%20https:/www.facebook.com/watch/%3fv=199945441752268" target="_blank">Jansen said</a>. “He is going to be one of the greatest presidents of the United States.”</p>
<p>According to local media reports and social media feeds,<b> </b>a handful of prophets traveled to Washington for Trump’s speech on January 6. They included North Carolina evangelist Charlie Shamp, who tweeted a photo of himself just below the steps where crowds were storming the Capitol and produced a video about the experience. “Don’t let the media lie to you,” Shamp later wrote, from a Twitter account that has since been deleted. (He has moved to Parler.) “We peacefully assembled outside the building to voice our protest against this fraudulent election and pray for America!”</p>
<p>Within a day of the Capitol insurrection, a few other prophets who had prophesied a Trump win apologized: Johnson, as well as California pastor <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShawnBolz/photos/a.10154502658655657/10165166387510657/?type=3" target="_blank">Shawn Bolz</a> and Denver pastor <a href="https://rlorensandford.com/prophetic-moments/an-open-apology-how-and-why-i-got-it-wrong/" target="_blank">Loren Sandford</a>. Johnson published a <a href="https://cf.jeremiahjohnson.tv/jjm-apology-01-07-eub" target="_blank">long explanation</a>, saying he had “misinterpreted” dreams and wished to “repent and ask your forgiveness.”</p>
<p>“I do not blame God’s people for insufficient prayer that resulted in Donald Trump’s losing the election, nor do I blame any kind of election fraud,” he wrote. “I am simply convinced God Himself removed him and there was nothing that any human being could have done about it.”</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/64/12/db2b242545dc94ba7cb520c59911/123051792-1037091046796679-1545909241519990011-n.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Blowback was swift. A few days later, Johnson <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1089599701545813&amp;id=100014873790327" target="_blank">wrote on Facebook</a> that he had received “multiple death threats and thousands upon thousands of emails from Christians saying the nastiest and most vulgar things I have ever heard toward my family and ministry.” He also said he<b> </b>was losing financial support “every hour and counting.” (Johnson declined<b> </b>an interview request made through Brown, a mentor.)</p>
<p>“He lost a lot of monthly support,” Brown told me. “He said people were unsubscribing from his email list at such a high rate, it crashed his server.”</p>
<p>A few more apologies followed. Vallotton, who had retracted his apology after hearing from “thousands” of angry followers<i>, </i><a href="https://www.redding.com/story/news/local/2021/01/11/bethel-california-church-leader-reposts-trump-biden-election-apology-video/6624635002/" target="_blank">reinstated it on January 8</a><i>. </i>Talk show host Sid Roth, as well as Jennifer LeClaire, the former editor of <i>Charisma</i> magazine (whose publisher, Stephen Strang, predicted that Trump <a href="https://www.charismamag.com/blogs/the-strang-report/34796-i-agree-with-bannon-trump-will-top-400-electors-in-2020-partly-due-to-christian-vote" target="_blank">would top 400 electors</a>), also apologized, with LeClaire <a href="https://365prophetic.com/2021/01/28/jennifer-leclaire-repents-on-behalf-of-modern-day-prophetic-movement/" target="_blank">writing</a>: “I believe some prophets who prophesied a Trump win never heard God at all. They merely tapped into the popular prophetic opinion because it was what so many in the church wanted to hear.”</p>
<p>Comments like these have prompted discussions around the charismatic world on podcasts, email threads, Twitter and Facebook. The overriding emotion in reading them is anger at the prophets—in some cases, for making false declarations and, in other cases, for apologizing for those declarations. Brown told me pastors have reached out to him asking how to handle the fallout in their congregations. Goll used words like “toxic,” “mudslinging,” “disappointment” and “disillusion” to describe the flood of invective from Christians who feel duped by false prophecies. But a sizable share of believers, at least those active online, seem to be holding out for a Trump resurrection sometime this spring. </p>
<br />
<p>That has left prophets like Johnson and LeClaire calling on Pentecostal and charismatic Christians to rethink what prophecy should and should not be in the 21st century. So far, they and other movement leaders have opted to address false prophets privately. “Some people are spoken to and don’t respond. Some people respond quickly,” Goll says. </p>
<p>That’s not enough for Rosebrough, who doesn’t see the movement reforming itself unless it can call out false prophets by name. “There are never any efforts to validate any of the claims made,” he says. “The more outrageous the claims, the truer it has to be. And if you are critical of these things, God will curse you as opposing his prophets.” (On February 11, Enlow hit back, slamming the would-be reformers with a statement titled “<a href="https://restore7.org/blog/2021/2/11/an-apostolic-rebuke-and-entreaty-for-those-blaming-the-prophets" target="_blank">An Apostolic Rebuke and Entreaty for Those Blaming the Prophets</a>.”)</p>
<p>Beverley, the Tyndale University professor, worries the widespread fidelity to Trump prophecies is part of a broader embrace of conspiratorial thinking in America. In a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/QAnon-Deception-Everything-Dangerous-Conspiracy/dp/B08R6PFMH1" target="_blank">new book</a>, he links the prophetic movement to the far-right QAnon conspiracy: Leaders of both, he says, have said all along that Trump would win and continue to push the idea that this will happen in March. Beverly, however, believes the charismatic prophets are likely to move on if nothing happens at that point.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>But Brown is not counting on it. On February 8, he and Brooklyn pastor Joseph Mattera began organizing secret monthly meetings over Zoom with a new confederation of 20 prophetic leaders, representing various streams of the movement across ethnic, racial and denominational lines. Their aim is to set up guidelines for public prophecies and requirements for accountability. One idea: The group could demand that anyone who wants its imprimatur needs to sign on to certain rules. Those who don’t “will be left out of our circles,” as Brown puts it.</p>
<p>Yet even Brown admits these measures will go only so far, given the extent to which the evangelical church has become entwined with Trump’s strain of politics. “How did we become so politicized?” he wonders. “How did so many of us end up with an almost a cultlike devotion to a leader, compromise our ethics for a seat at the table and drape the Gospel in an American flag?”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>After the Senate acquitted Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial last Saturday, <a href="https://www.axios.com/capitol-siege-trump-republicans-bf26f1cf-f7fa-456b-9629-252c80d5dd8d.html" target="_blank">Democratic and Republican</a> leaders began coalescing around a new way to bring to justice those responsible for the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol: a Congressional inquiry modeled on the 9/11 Commission. Assistant House Speaker Katherine Clark <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/16/katherine-clark-capitol-riot-commission-469118" target="_blank">called</a> it “the next step to getting to truth and accountability,” and Nancy Pelosi is already conferring with veterans of the 9/11 Commission as House Democrats prepare to adapt that framework for the current moment.</p>
<p>But while such a fact-finding mission might help to get to the bottom of just how the Capitol was so vulnerable to attack, it is far from clear that it will provide the kind of accountability that is needed for the leaders, including Trump and others in his orbit, who share responsibility. In fact, it could even get in the way.</p>
<p>If the Washington establishment is serious about holding the former president accountable, it will need to pursue a criminal investigation—which means the Department of Justice will need to get involved.</p>
<p>Needless to say, a criminal investigation of a former president—to say nothing of an actual prosecution—would be as unprecedented as the impeachment proceeding that just ended. But the Senate has already rendered its judgment on the issue: A bipartisan majority of the Senate—short of the necessary supermajority to convict, but 57 votes all the same—appears to have concluded that Trump is guilty of “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/11/us/articles-impeachment-trump.html" target="_blank">incitement of insurrection</a>,” a federal crime. The criminal process has already been recognized by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who in voting to acquit claimed that the appropriate mechanism for holding former federal officeholders accountable is the judicial system—through criminal prosecution and civil litigation—not congressional inquiry.</p>
<p>That makes it critical for the sake of setting a precedent that the Justice Department conduct a serious and thorough criminal investigation of Trump and those around him for any unlawful behavior in the final months of his administration.</p>
<p>There were already <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/magazine/trump-investigations-criminal-prosecutions.html" target="_blank">significant questions</a> about whether Trump had violated federal criminal laws long before the 2020 election—as a result of his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/us/donald-trump-taxes-guide.html?referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">financial</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/09/us/donald-trump-taxes-las-vegas.html?referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank">dealings</a> prior to taking office, his <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/obstruction-of-justice-10-times-trump-may-have-obstructed-justice-mueller-report/" target="_blank">obstruction</a> of the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller, his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/16/21024282/bribery-trump-impeachment-report-democrats" target="_blank">attempt to extort</a> the Ukrainian president (the subject of his first impeachment), or his role in Michael Cohen’s <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-eight-counts-including-criminal-tax" target="_blank">payment of hush money</a> to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The merits of those respective investigations varied, but regardless, there was at least a plausible case to be made that the final referendum on all of them should be at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/opinion/trump-prosecution.html" target="_blank">the ballot box</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/opinion/trump-impeach-constitution.html" target="_blank">dealt with solely via impeachment</a>.</p>
<p>That argument was <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/11/20/the-case-for-prosecuting-trump/" target="_blank">dubious on its face</a>—particularly because it seemed to prejudge what fuller investigations into any of those areas might actually reveal—but it is clearly irrelevant now, when we are talking about acts Trump committed in the lame-duck period between the election and Joe Biden’s inauguration. There was one obvious political check for misconduct during this transition period—post-presidential impeachment and disqualification from holding future office—but Senate Republicans just closed off that option.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the House managers made a strong case that Trump’s words and actions leading up to—and during—the insurrection <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/us/militias-republicans-michigan.html#click=https://t.co/O8cD0bblaE" target="_blank">encouraged</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/political-questions-and-impeachment/617969/" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/january-6-impeachment-context/617967/" target="_blank">deadly violence</a>, even without calling any witnesses or conducting a full <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/investigate-donald-trump/617650/" target="_blank">investigation</a>. The Justice Department might ultimately determine that it could not overcome the challenge that a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/us/politics/donald-trump-crime.html" target="_blank">potential</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-trump-isnt-guilty-of-incitement-11610303966" target="_blank">defense</a> under the First Amendment would pose in a criminal trial of Trump. But there remains strikingly little we know about Trump’s actual behavior in the White House during the siege, and what we do know is more than sufficient to justify further inquiry. This is the sort of thing that criminal investigators excel at—reconstructing what happened in a discrete period of time through witness interviews; documents, notes and other government records, not to mention the considerable leverage afforded by the ability to use immunity and cooperation agreements to secure testimony.</p>
<p>A criminal investigation could also look into and hold Trump accountable for a broader range of illegal behavior than the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/13/opinion/trump-impeachment-acquitted.html" target="_blank">narrowly focused</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/01/10/trump-impeachment-articles-incite-insurrection-seditious-conspiracy-456937" target="_blank">impeachment charge</a>. Rather amazingly, Trump’s conduct around the Capitol siege has largely overshadowed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-transcript-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/2768e0cc-4ddd-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html" target="_blank">the recorded call</a> that he had just days earlier with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump implored Raffensperger to find a way to swing the vote total in Trump’s favor. That call came on the heels of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/01/03/president-trump-joins-call-urging-state-legislators-to-review-evidence-and-consider-decertifying-unlawful-election-results/" target="_blank">other</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/20/michigan-gop-dc-trump-election-438690" target="_blank">reports</a> of contacts between Trump and state officials—including two top Michigan Republicans who traveled to the White House to meet with Trump—a meeting about whose contents we know little to nothing about. These interactions may have <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2021/01/06/wanted-lead-suspect-in-election-fraud-conspiracy/" target="_blank">violated</a> multiple <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/conspiracy-against-rights" target="_blank">criminal</a> <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/20511" target="_blank">statutes</a> that prohibit efforts to falsify federal election results.</p>
<p>As many have pointed out, it is possible that Trump honestly believed the various conspiracy theories and lies that he invoked with Raffensperger and others—a potentially strong defense to criminal liability if true—but this generous speculation about his mental state is not justified. A month ago, Trump controlled the country’s nuclear stockpile with the near-total support of the Republican Party. Our starting presumption should be that he is relatively in touch with reality, not that he is deluded. Then-Vice President Mike Pence and Trump’s Cabinet tacitly confirmed as much when they declined to invoke the 25th Amendment, despite calls that they do so.</p>
<p>The Biden administration has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/president-elect-biden-wary-trump-focused-investigations-sources-say-n1247959" target="_blank">signaled</a> that it is reluctant to oversee a prosecution of the former president, and Biden himself <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/13/901679755/one-tough-question-for-doj-if-biden-is-elected-whether-to-prosecute-trump" target="_blank">said</a> during the campaign that it would be very unusual and probably not very “good for democracy—to be talking about prosecuting former presidents.” This is an eminently reasonable view, but it ignores the potential benefits of an orderly prosecution, assuming one is warranted: It would signal to Americans that no one in this country is truly above the law—not even former presidents with vocal defenders on Capitol Hill and on talk shows—and it would provide a powerful deterrent to elite misconduct.</p>
<p>Other advanced democracies have shown that serious, publicly accepted prosecutions of leaders are legitimate and viable, including the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/03/opinions/berlusconi-trump-2024-election-ben-ghiat/index.html" target="_blank">prosecutions</a> of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi in Italy and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/world/middleeast/benjamin-netanyahu-trial.html" target="_blank">ongoing prosecution</a> of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—while still in office—in Israel. A <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/project/towards-non-recurrence-accountability/" target="_blank">report</a> published in December by Protect Democracy, a group of former government officials and scholars dedicated to preventing the U.S. from sliding into authoritarianism, concluded that there is “increasingly firm evidence from other countries’ experiences that prosecutions after periods of grave government misconduct deter similar behavior by future political leaders; and they possibly weaken incentives for those with nefarious objectives to run for office.”</p>
<p>Trump is reportedly already under investigation at the state level, and the Biden Justice Department might be tempted to leave matters to prosecutors in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/13/trump-impeachment-witch-hunt-469001" target="_blank">Georgia</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/nyregion/trump-taxes-cy-vance.html" target="_blank">New York</a>. But for reasons both principled and practical, if a president committed conduct that violated federal law, he should incur consequences under federal law—particularly when that conduct involves something as serious as corrupting our most basic democratic processes. Local prosecutors are also less well-resourced and may find it difficult to pursue leads that do not directly pertain to Trump’s conduct in their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>None of this means that a commission is the wrong move. But the analogy between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Capitol siege isn’t as close as the commission’s supporters might think, and it suggests some cautions. There was no question about who was responsible for 9/11, and it was already clear that the U.S. government would make maximal effort to bring the perpetrators to justice. That is not as obvious today. In addition to gathering information on systemic and organizational problems that impeded the preparation and response by federal law enforcement, it is imperative that the government ensure justice is served and everyone is held fully accountable for their roles under the law.</p>
<p>So in moving forward, it is critical for congressional leaders to carefully circumscribe the commission’s mandate—perhaps one limited to failures in preparation and planning within law enforcement agencies—and to coordinate with incoming leaders at the Justice Department to ensure that it doesn’t supplant or unduly interfere with any criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Next Monday, Merrick Garland will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his confirmation hearing to be Biden’s attorney general. He will likely be circumspect about the prospect of any future investigation concerning Trump, but he put <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2020/09/25/when-the-rule-of-law-turns-into-rule-by-law/" target="_blank">the relevant principle</a> well himself when he <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/joe-biden-introduces-doj-nominees-merrick-garland-transcript" target="_blank">accepted</a> Biden’s nomination for the job: “The essence of the rule of law is that like cases are treated alike. That there not be one rule for Democrats, and another for Republicans, one rule for friends, another for foes, one rule for the powerful, another for the powerless.” </p>
<p>Whether a prosecution is ultimately warranted or not, an orderly criminal investigation now remains the most appropriate avenue for accountability for Trump’s outrageous conduct during the transition. Perhaps even more importantly, it is the best deterrent to more serious misconduct on the part of a future lame-duck president—particularly one who, like Trump, seems intent on staying in power no matter what it takes, and no matter what sorts of death and destruction it might entail.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>Well, it’s on. </p>
<p>Donald Trump ended his post-presidency silence not with a blast at President Joe Biden, or at the left, or at the House impeachment managers, but at the true enemy—Mitch McConnell. </p>
<p>The Trump forces aren’t forming a third party, but they do want to take over—or more accurately—maintain their current grip on the GOP, and McConnell is an obstacle. </p>
<p>The Senate minority leader declared his independence from Trump in his lacerating speech at the end of the Senate impeachment trial, perhaps the most damning vote of acquittal in a couple of centuries of Anglo-American impeachment proceedings. </p>
<p>McConnell’s speech is as close to catharsis as he comes in public, after years of what must have been pent-up frustration dealing with Trump’s enervating controversies, after holding his tongue as long as he could about Trump’s attempts to overturn the election, and after Trump’s outsize contribution to the loss of Republican control of the Senate in the Georgia special elections. </p>
<p>True to character, McConnell’s cathartic speech referred several times to the 19th-century jurist Joseph Story, while Trump’s cathartic statement hitting back referred to a common smear of McConnell (that he’s compromised by nonexistent business dealings in China) and lodged several personal insults. </p>
<p>The Trump-McConnell fight isn’t exactly over the soul of the Republican Party, but it is over whether there will be significant space in the party for figures other than Trump to have notable influence over its direction. </p>
<p>At the outset, this contest isn’t a fair fight. McConnell, aka “Cocaine Mitch,” has acquired considerable new street cred on the right over the years with his hard-nosed work on judges. Nonetheless, there are very few rank-and-file Republicans interested in storming any hills for Mitch McConnell, while many of them would scale K2 for Donald Trump. </p>
<p>Trump has the passion and the numbers on his side. That he lost a presidential election, lost the Senate, lost all his election challenges that ended in the debacle of January 6 and a second impeachment, lost access to social media and still has such a hold on the party is truly astounding. </p>
<p>If Trump and McConnell ran in a primary against each other, Trump would win in a romp. If Trump and McConnell had competing rallies in Louisville, Trump would exponentially outdraw him. If Trump and McConnell had back-to-back appearances on “Hannity,” Trump would significantly outrate him. </p>
<p>McConnell’s task, though, isn’t to rely on his emotive power to create a loyal mass army of McConnellists around the country, steeped in Senate procedure and ready to go to the mat for the Byrd rule. No, it is simply to work to block electorally poisonous, or at least risky, Trumpists from winning Senate primaries, say, in the most extreme example, Marjorie Taylor Greene in Georgia. </p>
<p>Here, McConnell has cards to play. He can raise a lot of money. He has a practiced and effective political team that has already, back in the Tea Party era, fought an epic bout of primaries with energized populists who couldn’t stand McConnell. And he has an ability to focus on long-term goals that the easily distracted Trump, driven by personal animosities, does not. </p>
<p>At the moment, Republican voters are highly focused on prosecuting the party’s civil war, but, eventually, more of the attention has to shift to Joe Biden and stopping his agenda, which will require sending more Republicans to Washington rather than fewer. </p>
<p>McConnell doesn’t need this to happen next week or next month, but by 2022. </p>
<p>The Kentucky Republican’s judgment on electability is hardly infallible—he’s made his share of bad calls in primaries over the years and is prone, not surprisingly, to be overly conventional. </p>
<p>Still, the gravamen of Trump’s anti-McConnell statement, making the case that the Kentucky Republican is a political disaster compared to the masterly Trump, is risible. </p>
<p>Trump blamed McConnell for the loses in Georgia. Per Trump, McConnell sank the Republican candidates in the special elections by not agreeing to $2,000 checks in the Covid-19 relief bill in December. If Trump thought this issue was so important at the time, though, he should have made it a priority before the deal on the bill was cut, not after. </p>
<p>Surely, the most decisive factor in the Georgia outcome was Trump going out of his way in the most incendiary fashion possible to divide the state party against itself. </p>
<p>Trump claimed in his statement to have delivered a dozen Senate races for the Republicans over the past two election cycles. He certainly buoyed several Senate Republicans in tough fights in red states last year, but the contention about a dozen Senate races, like most Trump numbers, is a wild exaggeration at best. </p>
<p>Finally, Trump attributed McConnell’s win in Kentucky to the power of his endorsement, when the Republican was comfortably ahead in every credible poll and somehow has been winning Senate races in Kentucky without Trump’s assistance since 1984.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Trump is a potent political figure. Yet, his draw isn’t transferable to other Republicans when he’s not on the ballot, and he failed to get above 47 percent of the vote in two national elections against lackluster opponents. </p>
<p>Republicans still strongly identify with him, but it’d be a mistake to let him dictate the party’s potential future leaders or its ultimate direction. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>For Rohn Bishop, chair of the Republican Party in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, a low point in the party’s postelection civil war came one snowy December morning in the small town of Waupun.</p>
<p>Republicans were challenging ballots cast in two heavily Democratic Wisconsin counties, Milwaukee and Dane, based on <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/12/01/trump-wisconsin-lawsuit-four-voting-issues-challenged-court/6465214002/" target="_blank">a variety of technicalities</a>. It was part of Trump’s broader effort to overturn the results of the election, perpetuating his false claim that it had been stolen. Bishop, who manages the auto detailing operation at a GM dealership and has been party chair since 2017, was one of the few state or county party officials anywhere to break ranks—<a href="https://twitter.com/RohnWBishop/status/1330153166227337217?s=20" target="_blank">first on Twitter</a>, then on <a href="https://www.radioplusinfo.com/2020/12/01/12-2-20-republican-party-chair-of-fdl-county-says-there-republicans-are-trying-to-disenfranchise-voters/" target="_blank">the radio</a> and in <a href="https://www.wiscnews.com/bdc/news/local/fond-du-lac-county-gop-chair-pushed-back-on-election-challenges/article_4e60a781-0865-5dca-b816-554300a85c84.html" target="_blank">the press</a>.</p>
<p>His own party, he said, was “trying to disenfranchise people.”</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/ef/4c/4412d81840b7997d9876bbd86b42/secondary5-rohn-bishop.jpg" />
<br />
<p>It was heresy in Bishop’s Trump-supporting county. Fond du Lac has long seen itself as not just another Midwestern Republican stronghold, but the symbolic heart of the party: It’s home to the town of Ripon, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/11/30/paternity-disputes-over-birth-of-a-party/d10457e6-42c6-4c63-a52b-7bd6bb32ce9a/" target="_blank">sentimental birthplace</a> of the GOP. Bishop takes that heritage seriously. His oldest daughter, Reagan, is named for the former president. That morning in December, sitting down at a coffee shop with his wife, Jennifer, and their two daughters, he picked up a message on his phone. It was from Jim Kiser, a former county supervisor and former party official who’d known Bishop for years.</p>
<p>“I don’t want you calling me back,” Kiser told him. “I don’t want to have anything to do with people that are such traitors to the conservative movement. … So, when you see me, don’t say, ‘Hi.’ Just walk right on by as though I don’t exist.”</p>
<p>He said, “I don’t want to talk to you ever again.”</p>
<br />
<p>It kept coming. A donor who wrote the party a check for $500 — a substantial sum for the small county party — demanded Bishop return the money. On social media and email threads, Republicans called him an “idiot,” an “asshole” or — the one that bothered him the most — a “RINO,” for Republican In Name Only. (“A lot of these people who like to call you a ‘RINO,’ they don’t do anything,” Bishop said. “They listen to talk radio all day and they think they’re Karl Rove.”) Bishop’s supporters, including elected Republicans in the county, began hearing talk about an effort to unseat him as party chair.</p>
<p>Over the following weeks, the party schism that opened over Trump’s election claims would grow only wider. Republicans would lose the Senate majority in the Georgia runoff elections and Trump would be impeached for the second time. Handfuls of establishment-minded Republicans, including a smattering of House and Senate members <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/13/impeachment-takeaways-trump-gop-459068" target="_blank">supportive of impeachment</a>, became more forceful in their criticism of Trump’s behavior. Some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/11/business-titans-gop-capitol-insurrection-457901" target="_blank">major corporate donors</a> disengaged, and thousands of disaffected Republican voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/us/politics/republicans-leaving-party.html" target="_blank">fled the party</a>. But instead of backing away from Trump, in local and state party committees across the country, Bishop’s counterparts would begin reprimanding Republican lawmakers who crossed him.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/b5/10/27c04f66416db4a51bf9b3a2571e/secondary1-rohn-bishop.jpg" />
<br />
<p>By late January, that schism between the party’s traditionalists and its activist base had become the party’s preoccupying crisis of the post-Trump era. Even in defeat it was obvious Trump wasn’t going anywhere. Between the governing and populist classes of the GOP, said Whit Ayres, the longtime Republican pollster, it’s an open question “whether the party remains an uneasy alliance between the two factions or splits apart.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, that question will be answered not only — or even primarily — in Washington, but in local parties like Fond du Lac’s. And in December in Waupun, it wasn’t going well for Bishop’s side of the argument. He told his wife he was “beaten down.” He’d wrapped his whole life up in small-town party politics, and viewed his county’s historic place in the GOP’s history as sacred. But Bishop didn’t want to be chair anymore.</p>
<p>“If people are going to take it so seriously that they’re going to swear at me, I don’t want to do it,” Bishop said. “I’m not in this job to make enemies. I’m here to support Republicans and take the occasional shot at a Democrat. But I don’t want people to hate me over it.”</p>
<p>Then, as Bishop weighed whether to stay on, something started to change in Fond du Lac County. Joe Biden’s inauguration was approaching, with his promise to unwind one Republican policy after another, and the fault lines within the local GOP appeared to fade. The angry phone calls died down, replaced by more agreeable grousing about Biden and Wisconsin’s governor, Tony Evers, two Democrats that Republicans could <i>all</i> disdain.</p>
<p>Bishop knew Republicans who still disagreed with him about Trump and the election and its aftermath. But they were talking about it less. In a party that is laboring to come together, the GOP’s local outpost in his county was emerging as a test case for reconciliation—not by confronting the source of its division, but by papering it over.</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;"><b>By a chance of history and geography,</b></span> Republicans in Fond du Lac County have seen more of the evolution of the Republican Party than most — enough to make the area a real, if minor, tourist attraction for conservatives and political junkies. And it invests Bishop with what he calls an “extra responsibility” not to let his small piece of the party fall apart.</p>
<p>It was in Fond du Lac County, in 1854, that several dozen Whigs, Free Soilers and Democrats — Americans who felt politically homeless in their fury over the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2008/02/republican-party-founded-on-february-28-1854-008726" target="_blank">Kansas-Nebraska Act </a>— gathered at the Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon to form a new anti-slavery party, calling themselves Republicans. </p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/17/76/7091c73842bd835964aa00f24a46/secondary2-rohn-bishop.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Sitting with a Bud Light on his back porch one frigid afternoon in late January, Bishop said, “It’s not like we’re just some random Republican Party in Missouri. We’re the Republican Party of Fond du Lac County, so our letterhead says, ‘Since 1854,’ and we’re the only Republican Party in the country that can say that.”</p>
<p>Bishop, 41, was not a never-Trumper. In Waupun, where he grew up, he lined his driveway last year with Trump signs for supporters to take home. He helped register new voters for Trump, held a campaign training at his house and distributed campaign literature and miniature Trump flags. He watches Fox. And like most of the rest of Fond du Lac County, which went for Trump by <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/wisconsin/" target="_blank">more than 26 percentage points</a>, he said “it sucked” when Trump lost.</p>
<p>But Bishop is also steeped in a party that predates Trumpism — and whose story and values Bishop sees as bigger than any one man. One of his grandfathers volunteered for Robert Taft at the Republican National Convention in Chicago in 1952 because, Bishop said, “Dwight Eisenhower wasn’t conservative enough for him.” His other grandfather was a precinct committee member for the Republican Party in DuPage County, Ill. There’s an American flag on a pole in Bishop’s front yard and, in his driveway, a red 2008 Pontiac Vibe with the license plate “GOP 4ME.” A branch of the Rock River — the same waterway on which, in Dixon, Ill., Ronald Reagan once worked as a lifeguard — runs alongside Bishop’s backyard.</p>
<p>“Politics is my life,” Bishop said. In his town of about 11,000 people, he had served on the City Council, been the local Republican Party treasurer and, eventually, chair. And when he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzl8Q3l_cxs" target="_blank">appeared in an ad</a> for Rep. Glenn Grothman, the local Congress member, in 2016, his endorsement said as much about what attracted Bishop to party politics as anything else: “My 5-year-old is on a first-name basis with her congressman because she sees him everywhere,” he said. “Parades, pie socials, truck shows and fish fries — Glenn Grothman will be there.”</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/78/e3/40730a0f4c16825fda9e19f00907/secondary3-rohn-bishop.jpg" />
<br />
<p>It was “kind of cool,” he said, to be on a first-name basis with a Congress member. And it wasn’t just familiarity with important people he liked. Through the party, Bishop had made friends with like-minded Republicans from across the state. In Republican Party circles, he was a fixture himself. “‘Rohn from Waupun,’ that’s what we call him sometimes,” said Eric Toney, the Fond du Lac County district attorney.</p>
<p>In a normal summer, Bishop would appear in parades all over the county — between six and nine of them during a non-pandemic year, in towns like Eden, Alto, Eldorado and Van Dyne. The party has a float with a fiberglass elephant on it. Bishop puts his daughters, Reagan and Maggie, on the float, he walks beside it and they “throw candy and do the whole thing.”</p>
<p>In local political organizing, Bishop said, “A lot of it has to do with making it fun for people.” </p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/ee/01/90ab324a49a892baf1d1213d223c/secondary4-rohn-bishop.jpg" />
<br />
<p>But what Bishop saw unfolding in Wisconsin last year wasn’t fun at all. It was far angrier than the politics he was accustomed to, beginning with the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/wisconsin-coronavirus-election-results-lawsuits-184666" target="_blank">chaotic state Supreme Court election in April</a>, flaring again with the shootings in Kenosha and culminating with the election itself. Toward the end of the presidential campaign, Republicans were polling so poorly in the state — <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/polling-gets-it-wrong-again-in-wisconsin-what-happened-this-time/article_933f8475-3565-514b-8ddb-6e2c16a36bc3.html" target="_blank">a misread, it turned out </a>— that Bishop drove himself to the emergency room in September with what he later learned was an anxiety attack. And in the aftermath of the election, with only about 20,000 votes separating Biden and Trump in the state, Wisconsin, along with Pennsylvania, Nevada, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona, became a focus of Trump’s challenge of the election. In Madison, one legislative aide said her office was inundated with hundreds of telephone calls and emails every day.</p>
<p>“It’s been crazy here,” she said. “Crazy.”</p>
<p>To Bishop, Trump’s loss was “nothing to be ashamed of … I mean, they got 74 million votes!” But a loss was a loss, he said. And as Trump kept lying about what happened, and Bishop saw Republicans in his state supporting him,<b> </b>Bishop, as one Republican elected official in Fond du Lac County put it, “went rogue.” He accused Republican lawmakers of trying to disenfranchise people. He criticized the state’s Republican senator, Ron Johnson, a Trump loyalist, for signing on to the objection in Congress to certifying the election results — a position Johnson abandoned after the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. He chastised two other pro-Trump senators, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas, both of them potential GOP presidential candidates in 2024, for their role in challenging the results. On the day of the riot, he insisted publicly that the election “wasn’t stolen and what happened today can be laid at the feet of those Republicans who lied and gave protesters false hope.”</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/6c/b1/a40284c84b8daeb72b9fe4d37977/secondary7-rohn-bishop.jpg" />
<br />
<p>The next day, when Bishop was <a href="https://twitter.com/RohnWBishop/status/1347246416385728519?s=20" target="_blank">asked on a Wisconsin radio show</a> whether Trump should be removed from office by impeachment or the <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/09/08/trump-25th-amendment-constitutional-crisis-219739/" target="_blank">25th Amendment</a>, he said: “I probably need to calm down a little before I give an answer I might regret.”</p>
<p>To Bishop, the Republican Party’s entire postelection posture had been a disaster — from challenging the results to the House Republicans’ defense of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a peddler of QAnon conspiracy theories. “I mean, that was just unacceptable,” Bishop said. “Who’s going to vote for us if we’re the QAnon party? We need to have an optimistic outlook and tell people why they should vote for us and how we can improve their lives. Not the stupid stuff.”</p>
<p>The Republican Party, he said, had to be “pro-Second Amendment, and we have to be pro-life.” But he said, “We can’t be doing this weird, wacko conspiracy stuff.”</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;"><b>That might strike many Americans as a reasonable caution</b></span> for a party that had just lost the White House and the Senate. But within the party’s sprawling, Trumpian base, those were fighting words. A large majority of Republicans, accepting Trump’s baseless accusations about widespread voter fraud, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/09/republicans-free-fair-elections-435488" target="_blank">believed the presidential election wasn’t free or fair</a>. County and state Republican Party officials across the country — in <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/16/arizona-gop-trump-459772" target="_blank">Arizona</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/07/cheney-not-resign-wyoming-censure-466701" target="_blank">Wyoming</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/05/ben-sasse-2024-466424" target="_blank">Nebraska</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/27/post-trump-gop-462864" target="_blank">Kentucky </a>— began turning on elected Republicans considered insufficiently loyal to the former president. The base appeared to be carrying Trump’s banner into an internal party war.</p>
<p>Even longtime observers aren’t sure how one party will hold these two factions together.<b> </b>Joining a focus group organized on Zoom by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz last month — and listening to the participants argue about Trump and the direction of the party — Reince Priebus, the Wisconsin native and former White House chief of staff, said “we have to figure out how to keep this group together without killing each other, and it’s pretty tough.”</p>
<p>However, Priebus said Trump’s voice is “so important” that “this idea that you’ve heard from some of the establishment Republicans that we’re going to divorce ourselves” from Trump, “it’s ridiculous. It’s not even possible.”</p>
<p>Another former Trump adviser put the conundrum for the party more vividly: “There is no good path. I don’t know how you break up with someone like that. It’s like ridding yourself of a parasite that has its tentacles wrapped around most of your major organs.” </p>
<p>Priebus is probably right that the Republican Party will not divorce itself from Trump. But not every marriage is a love affair, and the hope of institutionalists is that this one might, with time, become a union of convenience.</p>
<p>When Bishop told his father, Rohn Bishop Sr., over lunch at The Other Bar in Waupun recently that he was “losing a lot of friends,” Bishop Sr. urged him to patient. “The anger and stuff will calm down,” he said.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/a4/6f/24f9dc024950bf1dab05bf2b4f6f/rohnbishop-nmahon10.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Bishop Sr. had seen a moment like this before, he said, when President Richard Nixon resigned. His parents kept a framed photograph of Richard and Pat Nixon on the wall behind the bar in their house. When Nixon left, he said, “That really tore the party apart.”</p>
<p>The comparison is imperfect. Nixon stepped down voluntarily; Trump lost by a wide electoral margin yet refused to concede. A disgraced Nixon didn’t try to keep control over the party the way Trump is now doing. But he did bring a sense of national embarrassment that rocked the party back on its heels — and eventually, after Nixon left the White House, Bishop Sr. said, “everybody got over it. It took a few years for the Republicans to get reorganized, but they did.” Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, just six years later.</p>
<p>“I think it’s just waiting,” he said. “The next election comes, and people start focusing on that.”</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, there are reasons to think that at least some segment of the Republican electorate is prepared to look past Trump. They may already have been looking past him in November. Of the state’s five Republican-held House seats, the Republican running — and winning — in each district in November outperformed Trump in his district. And Republicans fared relatively well down-ballot nationwide.</p>
<p>It is possible that, for general election purposes in future years, the rift in the party is overstated. Andrew Hitt, the Republican Party chair in Wisconsin, thinks so. “If there’s any disagreement, it’s about who you’re going to support in the next [primary] election. That just seems like a very run-of-the-mill primary discussion, which happens all the time, and parties work through that, and have worked through that for decades.”</p>
<p>That’s true. In Fond du Lac, the county clerk, Lisa Freiberg, recalled that right after Hillary Clinton’s surprising loss to Trump in 2016, it was the Democrats who appeared adrift. Eight years before that, with Barack Obama’s election, Toney, the district attorney, remembered hearing “the Republican Party was dead.”</p>
<p>The anger and sense of division, he suggested, is partly just a symptom of a normal postelection reckoning. “I would never judge any party based on what we’re seeing right now,” he said.</p>
<p>For the next four years, Republicans will have a common foil in the White House. They are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/24/republicans-voter-id-laws-461707" target="_blank">pushing, largely in unison, for new voting restrictions</a> in states across the country. And in Wisconsin, there’s Evers and his <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/05/tony-evers-promises-veto-republican-bill-covid-19-response/4406612001/" target="_blank">management of the coronavirus pandemic</a> for Republicans to organize against.</p>
<p>Scott Walker, the Republican former governor of Wisconsin, predicts Republicans will find they have more in common than not. Like Bishop Sr., he likened the moment to the post-Nixon era, “where you got different wedges of people in the movement.”</p>
<p>“As conservatives, we’ve just got to get back to the basics,” Walker said. “I think that’s what they did in Ripon. … The people who came together and called themselves Republicans in Ripon were of this core sense of not just being opposed to slavery, but of freedom, they were fundamentally about freedom.”</p>
<p>Asked whether getting “back to basics” required Republicans to not only rally around common ideals but also give something up, Walker said, “Well, we’ll see. Who knows what ultimately happens with President Trump. Obviously he’s going to be a factor. … But how big of a factor?”</p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;"><b>One sign of how the party may find a way past its divisions</b></span> came on Bishop’s lunch break one Friday in January. While on a walk, he got a call from Toney, the district attorney. Toney knew Bishop was under siege. But his opinion was that in local politics, the deeper relationships people have with one another — even among those who disagree — make it harder for people to stay mad.</p>
<p>It was a brief conversation, but on the phone that afternoon, Bishop and Toney talked about the party and about the Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon, the small, white frame structure with “Birthplace of The Republican Party” above the door.</p>
<p>“We do have some special responsibility in being caretakers of the party,” Toney said. “And that’s where we have to be united in bringing people together.”</p>
<p>In fact, by mid-January, Bishop said the criticism he took immediately after the election was already waning. Talk about the election was, too. (Of the 15 Wisconsin state lawmakers who <a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/01/14/15-wisconsin-republicans-tried-block-biden-win-before-capitol-riot/4161574001/" target="_blank">signed on to a Jan. 5 letter</a> asking then-Vice President Mike Pence not to certify the election results, none responded to requests for comment for this article. Nor did Rep. Tom Tiffany, <a href="https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/scott-fitzgerald-tom-tiffany-sole-republicans-from-wisconsin-to-object-to-joe-biden-certification/article_a6905688-0513-5f89-91a2-84e7c4cbe4a4.html" target="_blank">one of the two House members from Wisconsin</a> who voted against certification. A spokesperson for the other, Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, said he had no comment.) One night after dinner, Bishop’s wife asked him why he was being so quiet. He had been rethinking his decision to quit the chair role, and he told her “I might be making the wrong decision.” Bishop announced he was going to run for reelection, and he asked Toney to renominate him.</p>
<p>Nobody in Fond du Lac County knew what to expect when the county party met for its annual caucus in early February. Were the Trump loyalists going to mount a challenge to the local chair who dared to question their leader? Sam Kaufman, a county supervisor and the party’s treasurer, had heard “some grumblings in the background about having somebody else nominated for chairman.” Freiberg, the county clerk, had picked up on discontent — “just hearsay,” she said. In part for that reason, despite a gathering snowstorm, the meeting at the Sunset on the Water Grill and Bar, on the southeast shore of Lake Winnebago, drew a crowd.</p>
<p>And then—nothing.</p>
<p>Bishop was reelected unanimously. No one even ran against him.</p>
<p>Kiser, the former supervisor who had left the voicemail for Bishop, still feels the same way about him. “I think he’s an idiot,” he said.</p>
<p>But Kiser, a former vice chair of the party, had long ago pulled away from the party apparatus. And no one else stepped up to spearhead a challenge. Even among Bishop’s critics, Kaufman said, there was a recognition, that he is a “dedicated, hard worker. … He’s always just got his hands in it, under control.”</p>
<p>“Plus,” Kaufman said, “no one else wants it, I don’t think. It’s a lot of work.”</p>
<p>Bishop was so moved that when he stood up to thank the room, someone asked him whether he was going to start crying.</p>
<p>It was after 10 p.m. when Bishop left the restaurant and climbed into his car. The wind was whipping snow in off the frozen lake. Driving back to Waupun on Highway 151, he said, “So, I’ve got the job for two more years.”</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/34/90/8cbf3b33443a8f279c2155c895bb/rohnbishop-nmahon08.jpg" />
<br />
<p>The challenge for the party — how it knits itself together, what kind of candidates it gets behind, how it processes Trump — that challenge was officially his. He talked about the upcoming parade season, about his political aspirations — he hopes to become mayor of Waupun one day — about what it means to be a “big tent” party.</p>
<p>“You can’t be kicking people out of the big tent,” he said. “And that means I have to put up with people who don’t agree with my style of Republicanism. But then, they have to put up with my style of Republicanism. We have to agree to disagree, and all get on the same page.”</p>
<p>That same day in Washington, the House <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/04/marjorie-taylor-greene-house-vote-465855" target="_blank">was voting to strip Greene</a> of her committee assignments, while Greene — though distancing herself from conspiracy theories — took aim at a “a media that is just as guilty as QAnon of presenting lies that divide us.” On the other side of the Republican Party’s divide, Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/05/ben-sasse-2024-466424" target="_blank">was releasing his video</a> defending his criticism of Trump and deriding what he called the “weird worship of one dude.” The argument was still raging.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/72/f2/807e4a8c4c6dbdb3febbd7027e52/secondary10-rohn-bishop.jpg" />
<br />
<p>But in Fond du Lac County, Bishop thought he could feel his county turning a page — either back, or forward, to a different style of politics. He was optimistic that, at least in Fond du Lac County, the Republican Party could “unite around a nice message.”</p>
<p>“We need to be better than what we have been, because our message has been jumbled in the negativity of the personal insults,” he said. “We’ve got to be better than that.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>On Inauguration Day, Michael Pack, the controversial CEO of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), became <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/americas-lost-voice" target="_blank">the very first personnel casualty</a> of the Joe Biden administration. In the days that followed, Pack-appointed leaders at the USAGM-managed Voice of America<i> </i>(VOA)<i> </i>and other USAGM entities, including Radio Free Europe and Radio Free Asia, were also summarily axed.</p>
<p>Pack’s short tenure at the helm of the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM)—which he headed from his Senate confirmation in June 2020 until Inauguration Day—was rife with controversy over political overreach and skewed priorities. It’s not surprising, then, that critics have hailed Pack’s departure, and the personnel reshuffle that followed, as an overdue course correction that has brought back normalcy to a well-functioning bureaucracy.</p>
<p>But the problems at USAGM go much deeper than a controversial CEO. In fact, some of Pack’s initiatives—<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trouble-open-technology-fund-opinion-1528998" target="_blank">such as trying to impose accountability among unruly government entities</a> and to rectify security clearance irregularities among employees and contractors—were aimed at fixing problems that ailed U.S. broadcasting before he ever arrived at USAGM’s headquarters on Independence Avenue. And it’s more crucial now than ever to fix some of these deep-rooted problems, as the Biden administration attempts to reshape U.S. foreign policy.</p>
<p>There is one place in particular where USAGM has a crucial role to play in U.S. foreign policy: Iran. While many aspects of the Biden administration’s approach to foreign affairs remain unclear, it’s already evident that its Iran policy will be a major departure from that of the Trump administration. Whereas the “maximum pressure” of the Trump era saw Iran face growing political and economic isolation, the new Biden White House has made clear that it is planning a broad diplomatic push to reengage with the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>In its current state, VOA’s Persian service can’t be of much use in that mission. It ranks as one of the most out-of-date, inefficient and scandal-ridden broadcast services administered by USAGM, plagued by everything from poor management to lackluster content. Such deficiencies have hindered successive administrations from fulfilling the agency’s broader mission of bringing reliable information to unfree societies. And they have prevented Washington from effectively communicating with the most important constituency inside Iran: the Iranian people themselves.</p>
<br />
<p>That represents a critical shortcoming. Fundamentally, the long game in Iran has always been about the Iranian public square, and not the country’s aging and exceedingly unpopular clerical regime. It is the people of Iran who will <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/irans-uprising-pits-the-countrys-old-rulers-against-its-24409" target="_blank">help determine the geopolitical trajectory of the country over the long term</a>. The United States has every interest in helping to shape that trajectory in a more pluralistic and free political direction. Doing so requires meaningful engagement with the Iranian people, together with an upgrading of the essential tools—such as VOA Persian—to make that priority possible.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most basic problem relating to U.S. government broadcasting toward Iran is that it represents something of a black box. While it has become commonplace for officials to claim that U.S. programming is influential among Iranian people, there is in fact little empirical data that this is actually the case. Credible, independent third-party assessments of the true reach and appeal of VOA within the Islamic Republic are conspicuously absent from the public sphere. At the same time, extensive interviews with longtime observers of Persian-language media carried out in recent months suggest that U.S. outreach is increasingly marginal and irrelevant to most Iranians, eclipsed by more compelling and dynamic private sector alternatives, such as <a href="https://www.manototv.com/" target="_blank">Manoto</a><i>, </i>a London-based Persian-language general entertainment channel<i>, </i>and the Saudi-funded <a href="https://iranintl.com/" target="_blank">Iran International</a><i> </i>channel.</p>
<p>That amounts to a major blind spot. Credibly gauging the true level of VOA’s popularity among Iranian audiences (via social media metrics, direct telephonic surveys, and assorted other means) is an essential prerequisite to determining the true worth of the current U.S. investment in broadcasting toward Iran. Simply put, American lawmakers need to know exactly how many Iranians are tuning in to VOA’s Persian-language broadcasts in order to gauge whether the service still remains a “good bet” and a prudent use of taxpayer dollars. Simply taking the word of government employees who rely on those same funds for their paychecks just won’t do. </p>
<p>The second problem plaguing VOA Persian relates to content. The service today suffers from what might be called “content confusion,” with programming encompassing a scattered and ineffective mix of news, analysis and culture and entertainment programming such as reruns of CNN’s once-popular <i>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</i>. By contrast, VOA’s contemporary market competitors have far more clear-cut and well-defined roles. Manoto, for instance,<i> </i>is sought after by Iranian audiences for its cultural and entertainment content, like cooking and music shows, while Iran International<i> </i>is widely watched for breaking news and analysis. </p>
<p>This state of affairs, moreover, has been made worse in recent years by the cancellation of popular VOA political satire and cultural commentary shows like <i>Parasit</i> and <i>Ofogh</i>, which had previously succeeded in effectively bridging these categories. U.S. officials should reassess the VOA “mission” vis-à-vis Iran–what it is, exactly, that they are trying to say to Iranian audiences–and then reformulate programming to better match those objectives. </p>
<p>Third, U.S. programming toward Iran currently lags woefully in its reaction time. VOA Persian has persistently failed to respond to foreign-policy developments in a timely, impactful manner—much to the detriment of its credibility, and that of the United States as a whole. A particularly egregious example took place following the January 2020 killing of notorious IRGC General Qassem Soleimani, a major event with profound implications for Iran’s regional position and U.S.-Iranian strategic competition. According to former broadcasting officials, it took nearly a full day for VOA to cover the event—a lag that allowed the Iranian regime to monopolize and shape the narrative surrounding Soleimani’s death. </p>
<p>Such a state of affairs is simply unacceptable. The United States needs to be able to credibly, rapidly and effectively tell its side of the story relating to breaking developments in relations between the U.S. and Iran. Developing this sort of capability is essential to debunking regime falsehoods and mischaracterizations about America, as well as explaining to Iranian audiences the strategic rationale behind the latest U.S. diplomatic decision or foreign policy action. Reorganizing programming, as well as altering administrative functions, such as expanding hours of operation, will enhance VOA Persian’s ability to rapidly respond to events.</p>
<p>This ability to respond quickly is important for cultural programming, too. Among VOA’s most influential programs of the recent past is the short documentary and discussion show known as <i>Tablet</i>. Run by <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/why-iran-fears-its-women-73046" target="_blank">prominent women’s rights activist Masih Alinejad</a>, <i>Tablet</i> focuses on the struggle for social and gender equality within Iran, and is—by all available metrics—one of the service’s most successful programs, garnering millions of viewers and ongoing engagement on social media. Yet <i>Tablet</i> is currently undervalued and limited to just one 30-minute weekly program which is subsequently rebroadcast at later dates. Such a structure makes it difficult for U.S. coverage to keep pace with the rapidly changing socio-cultural conversation within the Islamic Republic, and gives the appearance of the United States being out of touch with the Iranian public. </p>
<p>The situation surrounding <i>Tablet</i> is a microcosm of the larger problem. Meaningful programs—those that tap into the trends and attitudes that prevail among Iran’s citizenry—do indeed exist. But because they are built around an existing (and rigid) schedule of programming, they tend to be unresponsive to the rapidly changing human terrain within Iran. Ramping up a more aggressive production schedule for <i>Tablet</i> and other meaningful shows, such as the newer <i>Chess</i>, a political discussion roundtable program, would allow VOA to better reflect the latent dynamism of Iranian society.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most profoundly from an audience standpoint, current U.S. outreach to Iran is simply not aesthetically appealing. Low production values and amateurish appearance contribute greatly to VOA’s failure to win “hearts and minds” among Iranians, notwithstanding the service’s inherent credibility as the authoritative “voice” of the United States. This becomes especially glaring when VOA programming is compared to its market competitors in the Persian media space—all of which (even Iranian regime broadcasts) offer more dynamic visuals and content than U.S. efforts currently do. In order to make VOA programs distinguishable from, and superior to, their competitors, the U.S. government needs to invest in significant upgrades to the appearance, professionalism and content of the service. In particular, the service could benefit from the creation of new, original programming geared specifically toward greater engagement of Iranian youth, who represent a <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/%20the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html" target="_blank">significant segment</a> of Iran’s 85-million-person population. </p>
<p>By their nature, instituting the reforms and upgrades outlined above will be a long-term endeavor—one that is likely to stretch across multiple presidential administrations. Even so, there are a number of near-term actions that the Biden administration can take now that would jump-start the process, with immediate results.</p>
<p>The first is to institute personnel changes. Over the years, many VOA Persian employees have come to be regarded in a deeply negative light by Iranian-American activists and regime critics alike, who have chafed at their overt political biases and their failure to properly communicate U.S. policy. In order for it to be taken seriously by outside observers, any reform effort—which can be driven by a new USAGM CEO with input from the White House—will require meaningful changes at both the reporter/editor and senior management levels. Moreover, such personnel changes will need to be publicized and promoted as a way of clearly communicating to outside critics that the U.S. government has heard their complaints about staffing and is serious about responding to them. </p>
<p>Another key priority for the new White House must be to encourage VOA to better leverage its inherent advantage: access. VOA’s close geographic proximity to the U.S. Congress and assorted executive branch agencies in Washington remains woefully underutilized by its Persian service. Little effort is currently made by VOA reporters and management to seek out interviews, commentary and insights from officials and subject matter experts as a means of giving the proper context to U.S. policy. </p>
<p>That is a grave error. As numerous studies have borne out, Iran’s population is young, dynamic and vibrant. It’s also westward-looking, and keenly attuned to America as a symbol of everything that their current, repressive government isn’t. VOA outreach presently doesn’t dwell on the institutions, processes and values that makes the United States so different from Iran’s clerical regime.</p>
<p>It needs to. In order to shed greater light on official U.S. decisions, more sustained engagement with officials by VOA Persian journalists and reporters is essential. Such a focus would also help correct disinformation about the U.S. government promoted by the Iranian regime. It would also give relevant U.S. lawmakers more confidence that American outreach toward Iran is properly capturing their views and is representative of U.S. policy—a state of affairs which, sadly, does not currently exist. </p>
<p>VOA Persian has an important role to play in the current administration’s mission of re-engaging with the Islamic Republic, and Biden would be wise to use it. But first, the service needs to be fixed, top to bottom. Whether or not the president delivers on that goal will be a key test of how serious he is about restarting a real dialogue not just with the Iranian regime, but with the Iranian people as well.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>Less than a week after taking office, the Biden administration announced it would restart Obama-era plans to redesign the $20 bill, replacing the portrait of President Andrew Jackson with that of abolitionist Harriet Tubman, after more than four years of uncertainty about the note’s future. The decision has revived a fervent debate about who belongs on our currency, and whether the change is just another example of so-called cancel culture at its worst.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to understand why some Americans might see the redesign as a radical break from tradition. For the past century, U.S. banknotes have featured a static set of Founding Fathers and presidents, government buildings and national memorials. This 20th-century consistency created the illusion that significant design alterations would sever our currency’s ties to its past.</p>
<p>But this is a misperception. In the 1800s, currency redesigns were not at all uncommon. In fact, banknotes changed regularly, and featured a vibrant range of people, scenes and symbols. The United States did not have standardized designs depicting only a handful of political figures until the 1920s.</p>
<p>What this history suggests is that we should not shy away from rethinking our currency today. Instead, the new $20 bill should be merely a starting point, encouraging us to think more expansively and creatively about the images that appear on our money—as we have in our past and as other nations do today.</p>
<p>Money, after all, is a powerful means of communication. It is a missive we send around the world—an ambassador of sorts. It is also part of our national identity and can help to remind us of our common purpose. Our money should not only reflect our country’s origins, but also who we have become over the past 250 years—as well as who we aspire to be. </p>
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;">Our founders knew that monetary designs</span> could help to inspire a sense of unity. Some of the first notes issued by the Continental Congress in 1775 featured a striking design with 13 interlocking rings (representing the 13 colonies) surrounding the message “WE ARE ONE.” The founders also shied away from including potentially divisive political and military leaders on our national coins, instead choosing symbols of freedom and a burgeoning national identity. The first coins made by the U.S. Mint in 1792 featured Lady Liberty, and she regularly appeared on U.S. coins throughout the 19th century. It was not until 1909 that Abraham Lincoln became the first historic American figure to appear on a U.S. coin, 44 years after the end of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Historic figures began to appear on circulating banknotes in the early 1800s, but they were far from the standard or dominant imagery. Early American banknotes featured a dizzying array of allegorical and historic figures, scenes and messages. This remarkable diversity is a reflection of the wide range of institutions that issued currency. At the time, it was not the federal government that produced these bills, but more than 8,000 private banks and businesses, which had the freedom to determine what and whom to depict. </p>
<p>The resulting images display the breadth of early American life, including scenes of agriculture, transportation and industry. One striking $2 bill made in 1861 by the Sanford Bank of Maine shows women weaving cloth in a textile mill. Private banknotes also featured scenes of domestic life, with vignettes featuring children and dogs—some inspired by bank owners’ own families. A touching scene on a $1 bill issued in 1856 by the Planters and Mechanics Bank of Dalton, Georgia, depicts a child cuddling a family of bunnies. While some engravings are beautiful and whimsical, others contain disturbing and painful reminders of America’s past. Images of slavery on these notes, as well as on notes produced by the Confederacy during the Civil War, remain the only depictions of Black Americans on U.S.-made banknotes to date (a pattern Tubman, of course, would break).</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>When political figures were featured on private banknotes, they did not exclusively appear in stoic portraits as they do today. For example, a $3 banknote produced for the National Bank of New York City in the 19th-century<b> </b>showed a muscular George Washington wearing a toga, looking more like a mythological deity than a president or retired general.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Civil War prompted the federal government to begin making its own banknotes, snuffing out the earlier private system and creating America’s first “greenbacks.” The next half-century was the pinnacle of American banknote design. The government produced many different types of banknotes—legal tender notes, silver certificates and gold certificates, to name a few. Each type and denomination had a distinct design that often changed with a new series. Varied and often beautiful, the notes of this era were part of a post-Civil War effort to create a shared national identity underpinned by democratic ideals. One of the most stunning banknotes of this era is a $1 silver certificate from 1896. It features an allegorical scene in which a female figure cradles a young boy in her arm and points toward the U.S. Capitol and Washington Monument in the distance. The design, named “History Instructing Youth,” was part of a set of banknotes called the Educational Series, intended to teach the public about democracy and national history, with an eye toward the future of the young nation. </p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Political figures were a major design element of this era, but they were not fixed on particular bills. When the government released a new design, the public did not interpret the move as someone getting “kicked off” the previous version of the note. And at any given time, circulating $20 notes featured many different historical figures, including Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, Alexander Hamilton and Pocahontas (depicted kneeling during her likely forced baptism), but not Jackson. He didn’t show up on a $20 federal banknote until the late 1920s. And he arrived just as the U.S. Treasury moved to standardize banknote design and size for security and cost-saving reasons. Today, all seven circulating banknote denominations feature portraits of political figures—five presidents plus Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin. (Circulating <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usmint.gov%2Flearn%2Fcoin-and-medal-programs%2Fcirculating-coins&amp;data=04%7C01%7CFeingoldE%40si.edu%7C3ce5f59e22cd44d0510908d8cf76d2fc%7C989b5e2a14e44efe93b78cdd5fc5d11c%7C0%7C0%7C637487456564414838%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=VkwIDODv0oZdSgvLgSJ7LN%2Fg%2BYmTIRClLTivVfQ42tI%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">American coins</a> also largely feature presidents, though coin imagery is a bit more varied because the U.S. Mint can redesign them more rapidly and creates special coin programs, such as the “<a href="https://www.usmint.gov/learn/coin-and-medal-programs/america-the-beautiful-quarters" target="_blank">America the Beautiful” quarters</a>.) </p>

<br />
<br />
<p><span style="font-family:'Jubilat', serif; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;">If the Biden administration proceeds</span> with the full scope of redesign plans laid out by Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in 2016 (before it was tabled by the Trump administration), we will see not only a change to the $20 note, but also the addition of suffragists Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Alice Paul to the back of the<b> </b>$10 bill, and civil rights icons Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Marian Anderson on the back of the $5 bill. These three new notes would break the century-old exclusion of women from being depicted on American banknotes—the last and only woman to appear in a portrait on a federal banknote was Martha Washington, more than a century ago—and would feature Black historical figures on federal banknotes for the first time. Beyond expanding representation, the new designs would reflect some of the major social movements of the past 200 years that have helped to move the United States toward its founding ideals of freedom, equality and justice.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/31/65/ddad9d7a4ddfa8b1d7fa75a4a915/grid3.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Still, the history of American currency suggests that this might be only a start.<b> </b>We can and should go further in rethinking U.S. currency, resuming the national practice of using banknotes as a canvas for the breadth of American life and democratic values.</p>
<p>Banknotes already are redesigned at regular intervals in order to improve their security features, a process that requires years of testing. Future designs will also make banknotes easier to use for people who are blind or have low vision. Since security features and imagery are typically developed in tandem, this means we will be presented with more opportunities to continue to rethink and revise. We need not recreate the frequency of change in the 19th century or the diversity of banknote designs for change to be worthwhile</p>
<p>For inspiration, we can look to our own historic banknotes and coins, as well as to currency designs from other countries. Our money could celebrate American achievements in the arts and sciences and reflect our diverse cultural heritage. It could also display the natural beauty of the American landscape. Nature designs depicting plants and animals are a common theme around the world and have been used as an alternative to divisive political figures. South Africa chose this strategy for its new note designs in 1992, following the end of Apartheid. The United States could also honor the everyday, often nameless, heroes who care for our health and educate our children—people whose contributions the coronavirus pandemic has underscored over the past year. Childhood educator Maria Montessori has been honored on Italian banknotes. Imagine if we put teachers or health care workers on American currency, too.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/c9/32/199fe9c543d3816892a787b0bfe3/jn2016-00108.jpg" />
<br />
<p>With the proliferation of digital payment technologies, some have argued that we are moving toward a cashless society and that banknote designs are not worthy of significant investment or careful thought. While new payment systems have undoubtedly changed what some transactions look like, circulation of both coins and banknotes remains high. That might change in the future, but it is unlikely that the United States will cease issuing currency for the foreseeable future. Money is, after all, more than something we use to make payments. It is an important symbol of national sovereignty, and U.S. dollars play a major role in global exchange. American banknotes remain desirable, and in some places essential, to commerce.</p>
<p>But our banknotes can do even more. They can help us better understand our national history and reflect the nation we are today. American banknotes are not statues or monuments. They are dynamic objects that have undergone change many times before. Thinking more broadly about them now and in the future would help to strengthen our ties to our past and to one another.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>For the first time in American history, a U.S. president has been impeached twice.</p>
<p>And for the second time, Donald Trump was acquitted of high crimes and misdemeanors as Republicans rallied around him, some even <a href="https://twitter.com/politicususa/status/1359602814901755905?s=20" target="_blank">ignoring the proceedings</a> before them. So is impeachment a broken process—or did this still matter?</p>
<p>POLITICO Magazine asked a select group of political and legal experts what they saw over the past few weeks, and how—or whether—it will echo through American history. Many saw it as a pivotal point in the country’s political evolution, if not a gripping news event, though they read the implications very differently.</p>
<p>It will permanently shape Trump’s reputation, said historians—as well as the reputations of the individual senators who voted to acquit. Others warned of a backlash against Democrats, or a violent anti-government movement emboldened by Trump being let off the hook. Some were more optimistic about its importance: The historian Mary Frances Berry, for instance, said Trump’s two-time acquittal would keep impeachment “rare and principled.” And quite possibly the final outcome is entirely outside the hands of Congress, or Washington: Geoffrey Kabaservice, the historian of conservative politics, thinks the final meaning depends less on what happened this week and more on the course American voters finally choose.</p>
<p>Their full responses are below.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘The brilliant impeachment presentation will indelibly shape Trump’s image’</h3>
<p>Perhaps too much attention was paid to whether House impeachment managers would persuade Republican senators to join them. Since it was always a foregone conclusion that those senators would rush to acquit, why did Democrats bother with this elaborate exercise? The answer is simple: The House managers addressed the court of public opinion and the court of history as well as the Senate. The disgraceful sacking of the Capitol was, like Pearl Harbor and 9/11, a seminal day in American history and, like them, it easily can be distorted in the future, spawning a thousand conspiracy theories. The House managers laid down an ironclad narrative, well documented and crisply reasoned, that will forever guide discussion of this event and prevent later, self-serving distortions of what happened. They worked to engrave the story in our national memory.</p>
<p>The single most important decision made by Representative Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and his colleagues was to broaden their indictment from the events of January 6, narrowly cast, and convert it into an indictment of the whole Donald Trump presidency. The storming of the Capitol culminated years of Trump fomenting violence at his rallies and scoffing at democratic procedures in the White House. The House managers crafted a coherent vision of a president whose lawless, bullying style was inevitably aped by his followers and led straight to January 6. Whether he runs for office again or not, the brilliant impeachment presentation will shape indelibly Trump’s image for years to come.</p>

<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘The lack of a conviction for Trump sends a chilling message’</h3>
<p>The failure to convict former President Donald Trump is unfortunate but not surprising. In effect, it reveals that violence and white supremacy will continue to shape American politics—as they have since the nation’s founding. The invasion of the Capitol on January 6 connects to a long history of white supremacist violence and terror. Throughout the nation’s history, white people have often used violence and intimidation to retain power—the list is long and includes white militias in the Antebellum South, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War and the Wilmington massacre of 1898. The insurrection of January 6 is only the most recent iteration of white supremacist violence cloaked under the guise of “political dissent.” The presence of racist symbols such as the Confederate flag and the noose underscore this point. </p>
<p>The Senate’s failure to hold Trump accountable—and in so doing, their failure to prevent him from running for office again—will have lasting, terrible consequences. The lack of a conviction for Trump sends a chilling message: Future presidents will face no accountability for inciting violence during and after an election. This outcome has now set a new and dangerous precedent, and aspiring Republican presidential candidates will likely attempt to follow in Trump’s footsteps. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘We were left with a show trial’</h3>
<p>The impeachment largely didn’t matter to history. We were left with a show trial, which amounted to little more than political theater. </p>
<p>This proceeding could have made a definitive case that Donald Trump incited an insurrection. And I think that evidence could have shown conviction was warranted—especially concerning the official actions Trump took before and after the speech he made on January 6, the same day as the Capitol riot. </p>
<p>But this impeachment was rushed through, which ultimately made it ineffectual.<b> </b>The House approved a single article of impeachment one week after the incursion without developing any evidentiary record. The House did not hold any hearings, accept any sworn statements, subpoena former administration officials or request official documents. At the time, haste was understandable. The House insisted that Trump posed an existential threat, and he had to be removed immediately. But once January 20 passed, that existential threat disappeared. </p>
<p>Perhaps Trump may seek some future office in two or four years. But until then, there was no need to jam through a one-week hearing without any fact finding or oversight. After January 6, the House could have spent some time collecting testimony, documents and other evidence to build a case. But the House chose not to. Instead, it sent its managers to try Trump armed with newspaper clippings, surveillance footage, presidential tweets and Parler posts. </p>
<p>It’s no wonder the managers couldn’t prove Trump intended to incite an insurrection. They had no actual evidence that proved Trump’s state of mind. When the managers tried to introduce a second-hand account of Trump’s intent based on a conversation he had with Senator Mike Lee of Utah, Lee claimed it was inaccurate—and the managers ultimately had to withdraw the evidence. Still, the House managers could have called witnesses to build a record during the Senate trial, and even threatened to do so on Saturday. But they didn’t. </p>
<p>It seems the focus now will turn to President Joe Biden’s agenda. So be it. Priorities matter.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘An act of rage and vengeance rather than sober deliberation.’</h3>
<p>This impeachment matters, but not in the ways many people would think. First, rushing through an impeachment with no due process, no witnesses, no hearings and no evidence of the crime alleged—incitement, which would require Donald Trump’s directly calling for physical violence, among other elements—will damage the impeachment process.</p>
<p>Second, this marks a new low in American politics, an act of rage and vengeance rather than sober deliberation. </p>
<p>Third, it illustrates how deeply cynical hypocrisy has become, in that Democrats cheered and laughed along with much more violent language coming from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/21/politics/joe-biden-donald-trump/index.html" target="_blank">President Joe Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KlwYaipwl4" target="_blank">Vice President Kamala Harris</a>. Fourth, it shows that the cancel culture is infecting even our constitutional framework. And finally, the headline will be “Trump Acquitted”—which means that while Democrats might hate Donald Trump, he did not commit an impeachable offense. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘Impeachment will almost inevitably produce a backlash’</h3>
<p>The second impeachment of Donald Trump has the potential to lead to a number of unintended, adverse consequences. Though Trump deserves to be held accountable for his behavior and speech on January 6—and I support impeachment—the political impact of the Democrats doing so could well be deleterious to Democratic chances in 2022, and will likely carry other long-term consequences.</p>
<p>First, we can expect that the impeachment trial will further polarize an already divided electorate. To that end, voters are relatively split on the question of whether Trump should be convicted. A Quinnipiac University <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3689" target="_blank">poll</a> released last week found that 50 percent of Americans said the Senate should convict Trump, while 45 percent said they should acquit. To be sure, the first midterm for a presidential administration is always a difficult one for the incumbent party. Thus, coming out of the box initially with impeachment will make it more difficult rather than less difficult for Democrats to court Republican voters in 2022, and it will certainly make bipartisan cooperation in the legislature more challenging to achieve over the next few years.</p>
<p>In the long term, impeachment will almost inevitably produce a backlash that will continue long after the process is completed. In turn, the process will strengthen Trump’s standing with his already loyal base, and will further alienate these voters from the political mainstream, given that a number of more moderate Republicans have voiced their support for the process. Furthermore, in the long term, this second impeachment may also facilitate a greater likelihood that Republicans use impeachment against Democratic presidents, making it a more common tool, and less of an extraordinary option to express political opposition.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘Trump was not exonerated’</h3>
<p>The second impeachment trial of Donald Trump has three distinct audiences: the senators, the American people and the incoming Attorney General Merrick Garland. The first audience was never the most important. The impeachment managers realized that no matter how powerful and compelling their case, most Republican senators had closed minds and would put party and personal political advantage above loyalty to country. Nonetheless, it is notable that for the first time in history, a bipartisan majority of both parties voted to convict an American president, even if the vote fell short of the two-thirds needed for conviction. Trump was not exonerated. </p>
<p>The managers pitched their presentation to the American people. If, as appears certain, Trump emerges diminished in the eyes of most Americans, his political career is over in practice, even if not formally in law. Already, a poll taken on the eve of the trial found that 53 percent of respondents opposed the idea of Trump running again, compared to just 37 percent who said they would support it. Trump also has much to deal with between now and 2024. His businesses, brand and approval ratings are tanking. He has $400+ million in loans coming due and faces an IRS audit. He has lost his Twitter account. He is under criminal investigation by district attorneys in New York and Georgia. He faces civil suits, including one by journalist E. Jean Carroll, who claims that Trump raped her in the 1990s and that she has DNA evidence.</p>
<p>Trump’s attorney Bruce Castor suggested, astonishingly, that the remedy for Trump’s alleged incitement is not impeachment, but prosecution. “After he's out of office, you go and arrest him,” Castor said. “There is no opportunity where the president of the United States can run rampant in January at the end of his term and go away scot-free.” Garland will have before him a consequential decision about whether to take up Castor’s challenge and indict the former president on incitement or possible conspiracy charges.<b> </b>He will have to carefully weigh the strength of a potential criminal case against the distraction and uproar that would follow from the charging of a former president.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘Congress must immediately pass legislation to shore up accountability’</h3>
<p>The Democrats had no choice but to pursue impeachment to properly condemn and hold leaders accountable for the horrors of January 6. It would have been much, much worse to walk away as if nothing happened. But there is now no question that the six references to impeachment in the Constitution—a whopping number that underscores how important the Framers considered this lever of accountability—are not going to produce real consequences absent a voting populace that demands fidelity to the rule of law from its lawmakers. For that, we need civic education and moral responsibility at all levels of our social order.</p>
<p>We also need new laws. What these two failed impeachments have shown is that Congress must immediately pass clarifying legislation to shore up accountability for the office of the presidency. Trump smashed a range of norms over the past four years, with the complicity of Congress. America dodged a bullet to the heart of democracy on November 4, and again on January 6, but we are far from out of the woods. We are already seeing voter suppression efforts raging back across the country on the false myth that voter fraud justifies politicians passing laws to keep people from being able to exercise their constitutional right to vote. That is the sad legacy of Trump, and it’s the regular American—not the politicians in Washington—who will pay the price with the right to self-governance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘Impeachment has a chance of remaining rare and principled’</h3>
<p>The two Donald Trump impeachments portray what appears to be a running battle between the congressional and executive branches. Unable to find ways to enact legislation to stop Trump’s policies, the House used its impeachment power to hobble the administration. Impeachment substituted for congressional action and helped to generate media coverage undermining Trump’s initiatives. </p>
<p>The second impeachment of Trump matters not just because we may be relieved of focusing on Trump. It also makes it unlikely that another president will be impeached after he has already left office and can no longer undermine government and policy, which the impeachment provisions served to prevent. Impeachment then has a chance of remaining rare and principled when it seems absolutely necessary to remove a president or other official from power, and not just another political exercise. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘He exposed the fragility of the norms that undergird our political life.’</h3>
<p>Donald Trump’s second impeachment may, in the short term, seem to have had little practical effect, since no more than a handful of Senate Republicans voted to convict. Trump’s supporters predictably will dismiss the entire proceedings as a partisan circus and witch hunt. But the case that Trump did in fact incite and inflame the mob he had assembled, and that he bears principal responsibility for the desecration of American democracy that occurred on January 6, carries much greater moral and emotional resonance than any of his defenders’ excuses. Over time, the reputational stain of the second impeachment will deepen Trump’s exclusion from mainstream American politics. He will not be included in any of the symbolic or substantive or redemptive activities in which past former presidents (even Richard Nixon) participated. Growing numbers of Americans will view his entire presidency as a historical aberration. </p>
<p>That will be an excessively self-flattering verdict. Trump may not have known much about American history, but he authentically channeled many of the country’s darker impulses into his populism. These included not only McCarthyism’s conspiracy-minded hatred of elites as well as the isolationism and nativism of the America First Committee, but even reached back to the anti-government animus of the 18th-century Shays’ and Whiskey Rebellions. He exposed the fragility of the norms that undergird our political life (most derived from the worldview of long-dead gentlemanly elites) and the ricketiness of our obsolete constitutional-political structures. He also accelerated the decline of the country’s international power and prestige. The significance of Trump’s second impeachment ultimately will be determined by the future trajectory of the country, and whether we collectively choose the division and dysfunction that Trump personified or the pragmatism and progress that characterized much of what once was called the American Century.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘This acquittal sends three dangerous messages to future presidents’</h3>
<p>This acquittal sends at least three dangerous messages to future presidents. First, you can with impunity use every weapon in a relentless effort to overturn the results of a free and fair election. Some of these weapons are more legitimate, such as recounts and lawsuits, than others, such as pressuring state officials, ignoring 62 losses in court and seeking intervention by government officials. The acquittal also shows that a president can incite a violent, armed mob to overtake and ransack the Capitol in order to cut short the constitutionally mandated vote certification without accountability. And third, it is now almost impossible to imagine a presidential offense that would lead to conviction in the Senate. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court explained in <i>Nixon</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Fitzgerald</i> that congressional oversight backed by the “threat of impeachment” is the sole means the Constitution provides to “deter presidential abuses of office.” Because they had the aftermath of Watergate in mind—where Republican leaders prevailed on President Richard Nixon to resign—the justices, like the Founders, did not envision the hyperpartisanship that has undermined the impeachment process. For all practical purposes, the majority of Republican senators have vitiated the impeachment, conviction and removal mechanism, throwing our government of co-equal branches completely out of balance. Disabling the fail-safe remedy the Founders bequeathed to us puts the country at grave risk. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘The exoneration of Trump will inevitably embolden those and their ilk who stormed the Capitol’</h3>
<p>Donald Trump was not convicted as a result of his unprecedented second impeachment, but neither was he exonerated. The shameless behavior of this grotesque narcissist is now an indelible part of our country’s history. That is no small achievement by the House impeachment managers, who did a superb job presenting the facts.</p>
<p>A second outcome of these proceedings was for all to see, for all times, the craven abdication by Republican senators who voted “not guilty” when called upon to judge Trump’s role in the insurrection. For them to hide behind an absurd interpretation of the Constitution that a former president can’t be impeached, rejected by constitutional scholars, was a cynical repudiation of their oath. If Diogenes, holding his lamp, were to seek an honest person in that group, the oil would be consumed before he succeeded.</p>
<p>Finally, the exoneration of Trump will inevitably embolden those and their ilk who stormed the Capitol. They are the point of the spear. It remains to be seen whether American democracy gets the shaft.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘The fact that these impeachments happened is vitally important’</h3>
<p>The first impeachment trial of Donald Trump was about corrupting an election; the second about the attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after an election. The fact that these impeachments happened is vitally important: Alleged crimes by a president in violation of the most fundamental acts necessary for a functioning American democracy can never be ignored. Poet Amanda Gorman brought that home in her Inauguration Day 2021 poem: “History has its eyes on us.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘Trump owns the GOP still’</h3>
<p>The impeachment of Donald J. Trump, Part 2, ended with exoneration by a craven Senate GOP. Trump owns the GOP still, and even the party members who think he’s never going to run again. A Senate staffer told me, “If this was a secret vote it would be 80-20,” and they were right. Does it matter to Trump or the GOP? Of course not.</p>
<p>It does matter to history. It shows that the country lacks a functioning political party that can stand up against a man who attempted to subvert an election through violence. It's a sad coda for a grim era.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">‘Every senator who voted to acquit will be stained in history’</h3>
<p>Ten House Republicans, including a party leader, voted to impeach, and this impeachment trial will be the most bipartisan in American history. It is a hugely important step, even with acquittal. This impeachment and trial highlight the grossest and gravest abuse of power by a president in all of American history. And the process, with the House managers methodically and powerfully laying out the long history of Donald Trump lying about the election, exulting in violence, inciting Proud Boys and others, targeting his own vice president and trying to subvert the outcome of a free and fair election, will be a part of history. These examples were there for tens of millions of Americans to see what happened, and to realize we came within an eyelash of a violent coup that could easily have resulted in the assassination of our top national political leaders. </p>
<p>Trump is stained in history, even if acquitted. And every senator who votes to acquit will also be stained in history. And other vehicles, including applying the 14th Amendment to disqualify Trump from future office and censure, remain. As do criminal charges. The failure to move forward with this process would have been dereliction of duty by Congress. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<br />
<p>If you tried to design a weapon customized to exploit every weakness in the U.S. health care system, you might have come up with SARS-CoV-2: the novel coronavirus. </p>
<p>The pandemic caused by that spiky virus, now in its second year, has rampaged across the country in part because our disease defense system — the critical but neglected discipline known as “public health” — has been so starved of resources for so long that it had been effectively dismantled before the coronavirus arrived. Without robust disease surveillance, stockpiles of emergency equipment and a skilled public health work force, we were all but defenseless. </p>
<p>As a result, for the past year, Americans have watched as their vaunted health care system, with its massive hospitals, top-flight surgeons and expensive technology, struggled against an enemy best fought with low-tech measures like wearing face masks and staying home. </p>
<p>We knew our health care system had deep flaws: Too little emphasis on prevention and primary care. Clunky data systems. A porous mental health system. Deep health disparities, arising from poverty, racism and decades of neglect. High costs. Uneven quality. And despite the gains of Obamacare, a lot of people who still can’t get affordable care at all.</p>
<p>And under it all, there was a deep, dangerous erosion in the social foundation of public health: trust. Trust in science, in medicine, in expertise, in government and in one another. Our national lack of trust will make recovery and rebuilding from Covid-19 that much harder.</p>
<p>“This pandemic has really exposed the failures of our health care system,” said Rep. Raul Ruiz (D-Calif.), a physician who represents a heavily Latino district in southeastern California and who leads the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “Our health care system is geared to take care of really sick people with really, really good and expensive technology,” he added. “What we are not good at is old-fashioned community health. Public health.” </p>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left">Pandemic as opportunity</h3>
<p><br />The good news is that<b> </b>health officials and policy experts know a lot about how to fix America’s health system. A cottage industry of consultants, advisers and advocates for a health care reboot has churned out volumes upon volumes of white papers, reports and conference proceedings for years. There’s even a fair amount of consensus on the big picture, if not the nitty-gritty. But change is hard, and for every would-be change promoter, there is a change resister, often benefiting from an army of lobbyists or inertia bestowed by the status quo.</p>
<p>So despite the devastation caused by Covid-19, despite the nearly half-million lives lost and the economic and social costs, the pandemic is also an opportunity. The work needed to contain<b> </b>and recover from the coronavirus might — just might — create momentum to fix things before the next catastrophe, which will inevitably come in one form or another, perhaps before we’ve healed from this one. </p>
<p>Any such opening may be fleeting. Americans have short attention spans, so policy makers need to act fast. Governors face many competing demands on their state budgets, some of which were hammered more than others by the pandemic economy. Fixing health is hard — and highly politicized. Some changes can be swift; others will take money and time. But there may not be a better moment to get started. </p>
<br />
<p>President Joe Biden has already made his health and pandemic priorities clear in the stimulus bill he submitted to Congress. He plans to shore up the Affordable Care Act and move ahead on sustainable public health, including creating a dedicated public health job corps. But with Washington polarized and often slow to act, states have an opportunity to lead and go big. Recovery doesn’t mean just getting back to where we were before the coronavirus. Recovery means finally fixing a lot of those things that everyone knew needed to be done, but never got done. It means using today’s crisis to prepare for tomorrow’s.</p>
<p>Traditionally, “public health” focused on<b> </b>the community — emergencies arising from events like floods or wildfires, contagious infections like tuberculosis, and programs like childhood vaccinations, maternal mortality and substance abuse. “Health care” was about patients and doctors and hospitals — really, about sickness more than wellness. </p>
<p>Now there’s a chance for states to better integrate the two, to make both communities and individuals healthier. And to finally make progress against racial and ethnic disparities — not as an add-on, or a box to check, but across the board. If a global contagion teaches anything, it’s that my ability to stay healthy depends on my neighbors not getting sick, either. </p>
<p>“Public health needs to be a strategy,” said Trish Riley, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, “not a department.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Prevention and containment</h3>
<p><br />The essential concept driving public health is that the health begins in the community — on diseases being prevented when possible, and identified and contained when they do appear. </p>
<p>So when public health works and bad things don’t happen, you can’t see it. If you can’t see it, you think you don’t need it. And if you don’t need it, lawmakers ask, why pay for it?</p>
<p>Nothing could be more wrong. Yet that misconception has bedeviled public health for years. After the Sept. 11 terror and the anthrax attacks, Congress and states invested in bioterror defense and built up state and local public health capacity. Then complacency set in, and the 2008 economic crash wrecked state budgets. Public health was starved again — of staff, of data, of lab and surveillance capacity, of basic equipment — whether it was facing disasters like fires or floods, a surging opioid crisis, or a strange new disease like Zika. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, some public health departments were trying to trace its spread with faxes and pencils. </p>
<p>“Looking back at some of our public health plans — they were from post-9/11. They were outdated,” said West Virginia Public Health Officer Ayne Amjad, one of many state and local officials who found themselves doing combat with a pandemic with a depleted and obsolete arsenal. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Invisible invader</h3>
<p><br />In the early weeks of the pandemic, local health officials didn’t fully appreciate that an invisible invader was at their door — a situation that was aggravated by the Trump administration’s and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s bad calls about testing and surveillance. From then on, the virus would always be two steps ahead of them — and as the vaccination missteps and emergence of alarming new virus variants illustrates, it still is.</p>
<p>“One of the things this pandemic makes clear is the perils of underinvesting in public health,” said Richard Besser, a former acting director of the CDC who now leads the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. “This is what happens when you lose public health professionals, when you don’t invest in data systems, when you can’t respond quickly to new public health crises that arrive.” </p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/46/5f/19502a1944c3b54e0f168ee2b86c/gettyimages-1215356258-c.jpg" />
<br />
<p>The goal isn’t just acquiring data. It’s using it strategically, including to home in on inequity and discrimination which have been so pronounced in the pandemic, added Julie Morita, a former Chicago health commissioner who advised the Biden transition team and is executive vice president at the foundation.</p>
<p>Fixing public health also means repairing the CDC, the federal government’s lead public health agency, which does its own science and research and which also gives states grants and guidance on challenges ranging from teen vaping to reopening schools. Biden-appointed CDC director Rochelle Walensky has vowed to rebuild public confidence, after some agency policies were undermined or politicized by the Trump White House.</p>
<p>But it’s at the state level where public health war plans become boots on the ground. States don’t need to wait for Washington or the CDC to tell them what to do. Though they do need Congress to invest in public health and set a consistent national framework to fight the pandemic, many<b> </b>key-decision-makers are in the states; whether and how they seize the moment will determine not just whether their residents recover from Covid, but also if America will emerge from the pandemic with its public health restored. </p>
<p><span style="font-family:din-2014; font-weight:700; font-size:20px;">Here are five key ways</span> that states can combat Covid and prepare for the next threat at the same time. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left">Rehire public health workers and rebuild resources.</h3>
<p>Perhaps counterintuitively, the Covid-19 pandemic<b> </b>has actually <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/cums-tph012521.php" target="_blank">depleted the ranks</a> of public health workers. The politicization of the pandemic meant some were fired, and others quit amid threats and harassment from people angry over business closures. Given that public health schools have been a popular destination the last decade or so, there’s a big — and increasingly <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-01/cums-tph012521.php" target="_blank">racially and ethnically diverse</a> — workforce to pull new public health professionals from. But states will need to make sure salaries are adequate to draw good people into the public sector.</p>
<p>Figuring out how to build up a steady workforce — instead of hiring a crush of new people in a crisis followed by a hollowing out — is essential, said Karen DeSalvo, Google’s chief health officer who was health commissioner in New Orleans as it recovered from Hurricane Katrina. “With public health, when [the crisis] is over, all the people who had come in to help you … everyone goes back to their corners. And the next crisis comes and you stand it all up again. I’d try to smooth that curve,” she said.</p>
<p>Of course, this all requires spending money. It’s been shown over and over again that investing in public health actually doesn’t cost that much compared to other government programs — and it pays off in lower costs for other public services. Total health spending in the U.S. is nearing $4 trillion a year; the CDC budget (before emergency pandemic infusions) generally ran under $10 billion in recent years — the equivalent of pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left">Get data and labs out of their silos.</h3>
<p>Public health preparedness doesn’t just mean filling warehouses full of stuff. Increasingly, it’s having 21st century data collection, and sophisticated laboratories that not only respond to a crisis, but help detect the next one before it’s too late.</p>
<p>“It’s more than just, ‘Stockpile gloves and masks and we’ll be fine,’” said Josh Sharfstein, who has worked in health at the federal, state and local levels and is now a vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/78/bb/35baa01e43f7b373bc57f1916ab1/gettyimages-1212265354-c.jpg" />
<br />
<p>States need to invest in things like connecting their own public health labs to other parts of the health system. They need to be able to detect emerging threats, not just chase them in the full-blown crisis. State labs on their own can’t be expected to handle something like doing all the genomic sequencing needed to track emerging variants of the coronavirus; the CDC, private labs and academic institutions play a big role. But upgraded and linked labs could contribute more. </p>
<p>And time and again, the pandemic has shown that states’ antiquated data systems aren’t up to the job. They aren’t interconnected, they’ve been full of gaps (as are the CDC’s), and they don’t detect “the signal” from “the noise.” And public health data is siloed from other health care data. </p>
<p>“We’ve got to erase that separation,” said Alice Chen, the chief medical officer of Covered California, the state’s online Obamacare market. “That’s the biggest opportunity and I think that’s the least addressed<b>.” </b> </p>
<p><br /></p>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left">Put primary care back at the center of health care.</h3>
<p>Integrating public health with the rest of the health care system doesn’t just pick up faster on crises; it could help shift the whole system more toward primary care and prevention. A primary care focus would be a change from medicine today, which is centered on specialists, subspecialists and expensive procedures — not all of which are necessary. It would put needed emphasis, too, on managing the chronic diseases that are the biggest burden on the health system, and on patients and families. The lingering effects of Covid-19 in some patients, so-called “long Covid,” though not yet well understood, may soon be our newest chronic disease challenge. </p>
<p>Rep. Ruiz, who volunteers in a street clinic when he’s back in his district, said the pandemic is a reminder that our system needs to provide more home- and community-based care, which can live at that intersection of public health and health care. Focusing on mental health, diabetes, nutrition, smoking cessation, maternal mortality — or even better, preventing them — can keep people out of the emergency rooms and hospitals, saving money and improving health.</p>
<p>A handful of states, among them Massachusetts and Maryland, are engaged in cost-containment efforts that can also nudge systems toward a more “value-based” health system that elevates primary care and prevention. The federal government, which has a lot of opportunity to experiment on a larger stage with pilot programs and waivers in Medicare and Medicaid, can do the same. </p>
<p>Even if Washington is slow to act, states have several other big levers to pull — chiefly, their purchasing power as an employer and Medicaid, the federal-state program that now covers about 75 million low-income Americans. The biggest employer in most states is the state itself, but few use their public sector worker and teacher health plans to drive change. </p>
<p>States that run their own Obamacare exchanges can use their influence in similar ways to boost primary care and prevention, although the relatively small size of these markets limits their ripple effect. The California exchange is one that’s making the effort. </p>
<p>“If you are a marketplace, to my mind, one of your obligations is not to only give people an insurance card, but to make sure they are getting the care they need and are being kept healthier,” Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee said. The whole idea is to keep people from getting sick when possible — and when people do inevitably fall ill, to keep them as well as possible for as long as possible.</p>
<p>More states now use managed care in Medicaid, and while there are good plans and not-so-good plans, they can give states flexibility on how to spend health care dollars, whether it be telemedicine or addressing social conditions that lead to poor health. And states can hold these plans accountable. </p>
<p>“If you believe that primary care is the most important single intervention to correct health care differentials — race, ethnicity, income — you need to ask, what can Medicaid do?” said David Blumenthal, the president of the Commonwealth Fund, who was the top health technology official early in the Obama administration. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left">Tackle the racial and social disparities that threaten the health of all communities.</h3>
<p>Before the pandemic, health policy experts and government officials had begun to focus more on “social determinants of health,” a clumsy phrase for a simple concept: that people’s opportunities and environments, including racism, affect their health. Housing. Transportation. Education. Access to healthy food. Poverty. And more. </p>
<p>These circumstances are big reasons why poor and minority communities are so vulnerable to the coronavirus, and why so many of the pandemic hotspots are in disadvantaged parts of our cities and states. Nobody is advocating for the health care system to try on its own to fix all of the fallout of poverty and discrimination. But it has a role, often, again, through Medicaid health plans. Medicaid can partner creatively with other social service agencies or use its own dollars on needs that aren’t traditionally thought of as health care, but will improve health outcomes and health equity. For instance, Medicaid could team up with housing agencies, business groups, even a hospital system to get high-risk patients experiencing homelessness into homes. </p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/4a/f3/fd28e447452dbfeab7b0e38090df/gettyimages-1230973430-c.jpg" />
<br />
<p>Business and health groups can find ways to constructively interact. Former Surgeon General Jerome Adams tells a story about talking to some mayors who wanted to build sidewalks in their communities. His first thought was wow, they wanted to encourage walking to fight diabetes. Then he learned that they were actually trying to boost property values, and get more potential customers strolling into stores. And then he realized that it didn’t matter, the sidewalks would still fight diabetes — and create a way for business and health groups to join forces. Different goals. Shared gains.</p>
<p>“It’s not just a health care conversation. It’s an economic conversation, and health care is part of that conversation,” said Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Jessica Altman. “What part of this is the health care system’s responsibility to solve, and which is all of government’s responsibility?”</p>
<p>The pandemic, with its stark racial, ethnic and economic disparities, brought all that home. It turned social determinants from a talking point to an agenda item, entwined with, though not identical to, the national reckoning over race.</p>
<p>Every sector of society and the economy has been hit by the pandemic — and every one can be rebuilt with health and equity in mind. “We don’t just go back to where we were, because we weren’t in a great place,” said Cara James, who ran the Office on Minority Health at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during both the Obama and Trump administrations and now leads the Grantmakers in Health nonprofit. Equity has to be built in, she said. Not a P.S., but an “S.O.P.” — standard operating procedure.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<br />
<h3 style="text-align: left">Prepare now for a coming mental health tsunami.</h3>
<p>Mental and behavioral health were daunting challenges well before the coronavirus plunged us into a year and counting of isolation, anxiety, economic hardship, disrupted relationships and grief. As we emerge, mental health will become an outright emergency; anxiety and depression are already elevated, and research has found that suicides often surge in the wake of disasters.</p>
<p>States should stand up hotlines and emergency services, as they work to expand mental health capacity longer term, including mental health community clinics, and a more robust behavioral health work force,<b> </b>including peer support and community mental health workers when appropriate.</p>
<p>“During the pandemic, everyone is triaging. Coming out of this, dealing with mental health will rise to near the top,” said Elinore McCance-Katz, who ran the Department of Health and Human Services’ mental health agency in the Trump administration, noting that not everyone will bounce back when the pandemic eases. “We can’t presume that when someone says, 'It’s over,' that everyone gets better.” </p>
<p>The federal government and the states should also expect to confront a rebounding opioid crisis, despite some hard-won pre-pandemic gains. “That is going to be a real driver of mortality — that and all the other deaths of despair,” said DeSalvo. </p>
<p>Still, the larger problem is that even before the pandemic, our health care system didn’t have adequate capacity. There aren’t enough mental health care providers, particularly in underserved areas, and many don’t accept the relatively low fees offered by insurers. Any “build it and they will come” state approach to growing the workforce will take time, so it should begin ASAP. States can also make sure their public employee health plans offer adequate psychiatric and counseling options, and create incentives like student loan forgiveness to encourage mental health professionals to go into underserved communities. </p>
<br />
<p>Christina Mullins, who runs West Virginia’s behavioral health, suggests that states need to improve their crisis services, including mobile units that can connect people to ongoing care. Congress can help by making permanent the emergency authorization allowing providers to be reimbursed for telemedicine — including covering telephone counseling and consults, not just audiovisual ones, for people who don’t have computers or who live in rural areas without broadband. </p> 
<p>One of the biggest salves for mental health is to open schools as soon as safely possible for a whole long list of reasons, including that basic need of just letting kids have what they call “IRL” — for “in real life” — friendships and in-person contact with watchful adults who aren’t their parents (although the Biden administration may find that it’s easier said than done). McKance-Katz also wants mental health and behavioral clinics opened for in-person care — safely, with masks, distancing and fewer people gathering at any one time. </p> 
<p>The bottom line is that it’s really hard for people to recover their mental health when they are facing all sorts of other real-life stresses. Recent <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7005a3.htm?s_cid=mm7005a3_w" target="_blank">data from the CDC</a> upholds that assessment — and it’s worse for minorities. People with severe mental illnesses or who are in crisis need to be connected with social services, to get help with child care, housing and jobs.</p> 
<h3 style="text-align: left">Restoring trust</h3>
<p><br />None of those changes are easy, and all of them require money, focus and persistence from state officials and federal partners. But people working on improving public health have come to appreciate a central challenge that affects all of them: Trust in public health agencies and expertise has been damaged to the point that it is causing real harm. </p>
<p>Rebuilding trust is a theme new CDC director Walensky has emphasized in just about every public utterance since her appointment. She has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/11/opinion/rochelle-walensky-cdc-director.html" target="_blank">pledged to lead</a> with “facts, science and integrity,” even when the news is more bleak than what people or politicians want to hear. </p>
<br />
<p>Yet the erosion of trust predates Covid-19 and Donald Trump, although the former president’s assaults on science and depiction of public health as the enemy of economic recovery deepened it. Right now, the lack of confidence in vaccines — the only way out of the pandemic — is where addressing the corrosion is most urgent. </p> 
<p>But vaccination may also be a second chance. If states and their federal partners use vaccination to show how governments really can keep people healthy, it could lay the foundation for rebuilding the national public health system we need to keep Americans healthier long-term. </p>
<p>“These are trust-building opportunities, and they should not end when the vaccination level is high enough,” said James, the former CMS minority health director. “There is work to be done. ... Address this crisis to tackle other issues.” </p>
<p>Of course, it’s not only health care that has been stained by mistrust, she noted — it’s basically every sector of civil society. But conquering Covid, rebuilding public health, fairly and equitably, is a good way to start.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>This winter’s wave of Covid-19 outbreaks was the worst and deadliest in the year-long pandemic, but some states managed it better than others. </p>
<p>Every state’s pandemic response looks different, but one way to easily compare them is to examine which states have kept their death tolls low and which are getting vaccines into arms quickest. </p>
<p>Some of the states that avoided huge spikes in Covid deaths since November have also been top performers since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/97/ba/aca342574322855c080e066464ae/screenshot-2021-02-18-at-12.37.04%20PM.png" />
<br />
<p>Vermont and Washington, which have been consistently praised by experts for keeping case and death counts low during all three surges of the virus, entered the fall with lower case counts than most. Both states have been quick to implement targeted public health measures when cases flare up, while benefiting from high levels of public buy-in. </p>
<p>Alaska and Hawaii have also been top performers, partly due to their relative remoteness. But both states also had to fight back surges in the early fall that could have spiraled out of control, making their success anything but inevitable.</p>
<br />
<p>Virginia’s death rate began to significantly outperform most other states starting in October, when deaths began ticking up again nationwide. While some of Virginia’s success could be attributed to regional trends and a milder winter than hard-hit Northeast and Midwest states, it’s also benefited from stricter mask requirements and gathering limits than many of its neighbors in the Southeast. Though deaths in Virginia are still rising, the state managed to delay its winter wave, buying critical time to protect more people through vaccination. </p>
<p>On the vaccine front, policymakers are looking to learn from a handful of states that have outpaced the rest. While speed is not the only metric for success, a faster rollout means more lives saved and a swifter return to relative normalcy.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/e2/05/60482b1c4a6c8ff63af069b14942/screenshot-2021-02-18-at-12.37.55%20PM.png" />
<br />
<p>Alaska is once again a top performer, having received an additional allocation of the vaccines to account for its remote rural communities. The state took advantage of the extra doses with an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2021/02/04/alaska-vaccine-covid-remote/" target="_blank">ambitious vaccination drive</a> involving boats, planes, snowmobiles and even dog sleds to cover the state’s vast and inhospitable territory.</p>
<p>North Dakota and West Virginia quickly administered its first doses by working directly with independent pharmacies to vaccinate their nursing home populations. The major national pharmacy chains are largely absent in these states, so they could not rely on the federal partnership with CVS and Walgreens that’s vaccinating long-term care facilities in virtually every other state — and has been slower overall to administer doses. </p>
<br />
<p>New Mexico’s health department has been praised for a relatively smooth rollout, becoming one of the first to launch a statewide appointment website that matches residents with local providers.</p>
<p>Connecticut benefited from being one of the first states to stand up mass vaccination sites, as well as a nimble <a href="https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-coronavirus-pandemic-71ad9b3f0144b4ec57d5320d7f924547" target="_blank">inventory management system</a> that transfers unused doses to other facilities at the end of each day.</p>
<br />
<p>The pandemic is far from over — experts say states will need to keep public health measures in place for months until vaccination is widespread enough to achieve herd immunity. And new variants that appear to be more contagious and more resistant to available vaccines could fuel new infection surges. But with an end potentially in sight, these states have positioned themselves at the forefront of eventual recovery.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<br />
<p>Our national recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic depends perhaps more than anything else on a nationwide vaccination campaign that will have to be bigger, faster and more comprehensive than any previous public health initiative in our history. </p>
<p>Which is to say — it’s going to be complicated. President Joe Biden has pledged to administer 100 million shots in his first 100 days, a lofty goal that even if met will still cover just a fraction of Americans. It’s already run into problems: States got off to a sluggish start in December amid fewer-than-expected doses and confusion over their allotments; the federal plan to prioritize health care workers and elderly populations broke down in practice; and news reports suggesting states were hoarding doses generated bad press. Meanwhile, the health care system is quite literally racing against time, trying to get a critical mass of Americans vaccinated fast enough to halt mutations that could render the vaccines less effective. </p>
<p>What’s more, it only gets harder from here. Over the next few months, the supply of vaccines will grow, but so will the barriers to getting those shots in the arms of enough Americans. The health system will need to make a sharp pivot from vaccinating eager populations like health care workers and older adults to those who are harder to reach: the under-served, the skeptical and those who live in remote areas. </p>
<p>“Supply will remain the limiting step for next month or two,” said New York City Health Commissioner Dave Chokshi. “Then we’ll be grappling with a different problem, with regard to demand.” </p>
<br />
<p>The good news is that states and cities are solving these problems in real time, trying new strategies and quickly recalibrating and implementing what works. So POLITICO decided to convene a “policy hackathon” — Zoom sessions in which we asked some of the sharpest public health experts from around the country to compare notes, identify emerging challenges and share the best ideas for making this complex vaccination effort work. </p>
<p>Our nine policy hackers — who came from big urban cities like New York City and Newark, as well as from rural states like Montana and West Virginia — said they have already learned important lessons about what works. Over the course of the discussion, some raised vexing challenges for which others were able to provide solutions. And they pointed to some key areas where their federal counterparts could significantly accelerate the effort by shifting priorities, providing better data and perhaps most importantly, do a better job communicating how and why vaccination is important, before it’s too late. </p>
<p>Here are their takeaways. </p>
<br />
<h2 style="text-align: center">PART 1: WHAT’S GONE WRONG</h2>
<br />
<p><span class="firstcharacter">E</span>very state and locality has its own mix of challenges. In some areas, dense populations make Covid-19 easier to spread. In others, vast distances make delivering vaccines logistically complicated. Some places have a lot of older adults, while others have more Black, Latino and other minority residents whose death rates have been high but who may have less access to vaccination sites. </p>
<p>One huge tradeoff state and local officials identified is between efficiency and equity; it’s faster to use online registration portals and mass vaccination sites, but those methods leave out vulnerable residents, including minorities and frontline workers who lack access to broadband, flexible work hours or reliable transportation. </p>
<p>Despite the differences in their challenges, POLITICO’S policy hackers expressed agreement on some key problems that have hampered vaccination programs nationwide. </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Poor information about Covid-19 vaccine deliveries.</h3>
<p>Participants said that perhaps the biggest and most universal problem they faced was a lack of clarity on how much vaccine they would receive and when it would arrive. The confusion makes it difficult to plan vaccination sites, operate appointment systems and sketch out projections for priority groups, leading providers to hold back supplies — to ensure second doses — even amid crushing national demand. </p>
<p>Biden announced in January that his administration would bump up weekly supplies and give states up to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/26/biden-covid-vaccine-purchase-462803" target="_blank">three weeks’ notice</a> on their allocations. Officials said that is helpful, but they really need more than three weeks to organize logistics, and they don’t believe there’s a good reason the federal government can’t provide more notice.</p>
<p>“I need two months,” said New York City’s Chokshi, adding that a longer ramp-up time would let the city secure vaccination sites, schedule staffing and make other plans — such as whether to rely on existing infrastructure, or in the case of a supply influx, set up mega-sites. </p>
<p>While two months sounds like an ambitious target, participants argued that vaccine makers know their production schedules for several months in advance. Those manufacturing plans guide pharmaceutical companies when they strike deals with governments to supply hundreds of millions of shots, and state and local officials should also have access to that information. </p> 
<h3 style="text-align: left">Slower vaccination of racial and ethnic minorities.</h3>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has shone a bright light on long-existing health disparities and societal gaps: Black, Native American and Latino people are more likely to become severely ill, hospitalized and die from the coronavirus than white counterparts. But Black adults in particular are still hesitant to get the vaccine. In studies presented to an expert CDC panel last year, respondents cited historical mistreatment from the health care system and concerns that elected officials are not looking out for Black Americans. </p>
<p>That combined with decades of diminished public health resources in communities of color has already contributed to distribution inequity: White women have outpaced every other group so far for getting vaccinated, according to federal data, though many people did not record race and ethnicity.</p>
<br />
<p>“One of the biggest and most devastating lessons for us in our attempt to reach high throughput ... we were pushing a large amount through mass vaccination clinics,” said Oregon Health Agency Director Rachael Banks. The state tried to be inclusive, “but [it] simply was not enough.”</p>
<p>That is common when governments prioritize speed, said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “If we're going to continue being efficient, then we need to understand that when we start seeing equity data is not going to look very good. Efficiency doesn't really generally lead to a lot of equity: It's kind of a first-come-first-serve, and we know who tends to do best in those situations.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Confusing data about vaccination rates.</h3>
<p>Hackathon participants described data frustrations with the federal government. For starters, officials complained that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine tracker, which publishes supply and use, tells a misleading story about the amount of shots states have received versus how many are administered. </p>
<p>Every state looks like they have failed to distribute as much as 30 to 40 percent of the doses they’ve received when the truth is more complex, said Florida Director of Emergency Management Jared Moskowitz. States are typically holding back some stock for second shots. </p>
<br />
<p>“That increases the anger with people; they think somehow we’re not getting all our doses out fast enough, even though we are blowing through our weekly allocations,” said Moskowitz. “Messaging correctly from the CDC … would help decrease some of the anger so it doesn't look like states are just sitting on doses.”</p>
<p>That may be complicated: White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt recently urged states <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/01/states-stockpiling-covid-vaccine-464447" target="_blank">not to stockpile<b> </b>supply</a> for second doses. But the officials said that’s not practical unless they have a better picture of future supplies.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Too much reliance on online and digital tools.</h3>
<p>It’s not enough to set up vaccination sites in underserved areas or communities of color. Florida did that, said Moskowitz — and it still did not go to plan. </p>
<p>“Because there was a rush to put shot in arms, everybody went digital” to fill vaccination slots, he said. “When you go digital, people will drive hours into a neighborhood if they can get that appointment, and that is what's happening.”</p>
<br />
<p>Seeing the trend play out, Florida came up with a plan to “take the technology out of it,” said Moskowitz. The state has since partnered with faith-based institutions and set up sites at churches. Moskowitz is also considering vouchers to hand out to people in need as a non-tech version of planning for vaccination sites. </p>
<p>Bridging the digital divide includes messaging for vaccination sites and information that comes offline, such as flyers about availability and outreach through public transportation and other strategic areas, said state and city leaders. It could be as simple as posters on the sides of buses that say we have “a plan for reopening” atop an image of a syringe, said Fresno County Interim Health Officer Rais Vohra.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Lack of funding and logistical information from the federal government.</h3>
<p>All the participants agreed they need more funding to roll out vaccination campaigns, set up distribution sites and employ thousands of people in the process. One reason is that unlike the federal government, states are not able to deficit spend; they can only tap funds they already have. But state tax revenues have fallen sharply because of the economic downturn, and financial assistance from the federal government has been slow coming.</p>
<p>“It's been really challenging for us to just reach out to different communities,” said Vohra. “Having more resources related to distribution is certainly welcome. It would have helped a long time ago.”</p>
<br />
<p>Vohra added that local officials need logistical information as early as possible for new vaccines coming down the pipeline, particularly the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid vaccine that the Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize for use soon. Its single-shot regimen and easier refrigeration requirements mean it could be a game changer for public health officials trying to vaccinate hard-to-reach groups, ensuring they are fully vaccinated without needing to schedule and keep a second appointment. But officials need to know now more details about its refrigeration requirements and other protocols. </p>
<p>“I know that it hasn't been approved by the FDA, so that does sound premature, but we really need that information now so that we can start planning for it so that the day that it becomes available to us, we are ready to go with all of the logistics and operational details that are needed for that vaccine — and for every other vaccine coming into the future,” said Vohra.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">Sluggish national rollout for nursing homes.</h3>
<p>Scientists agreed early on that nursing home residents, who have accounted for <a href="https://data.cms.gov/stories/s/COVID-19-Nursing-Home-Data/bkwz-xpvg" target="_blank">roughly a quarter</a> of U.S. coronavirus deaths, should be among the first to receive Covid-19 vaccines. But by January, many states complained about the slow pace of a federal program to distribute those key shots through partnerships with national pharmacy chains CVS and Walgreens. </p>
<p>The only state to forgo the federal program, West Virginia, finished nursing home vaccinations within about two weeks. The national chain pharmacies were slower, taking until late January to finish the first round of shots in the facilities amid scheduling complexities and the slog of planning ahead with each home to gain residents’ consent and project supply needs.</p>
<p>West Virginia’s early decision to strike out on its own with community pharmacies was part of “MacGyver-like” planning, said Health Commissioner and State Health Officer Ayne Amjad, describing a style of use-what-you-have solutions. “You take risks, but you have to know what's right for your state.”</p>
<br />
<p>Despite West Virginia’s early success in administering shots to older citizens, Amjad says her state is readying for tough work ahead with hard-to-reach and skeptical people throughout the state — efforts that won’t be possible without additional federal support.</p>
<p>“No one wants to come to West Virginia; the pay is low, we lack resources. ... But you make do with what you have,” Amjad said about the scope of challenges ahead. </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">PART 2: FIVE POLICY HACKS TO IMPROVE VACCINATION</h2>
<br />
<p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>n their states and cities, POLITICO’s policy hackers pioneered a number of innovative approaches to overcoming the barriers to vaccination. At the same time, they were clear about the limits of what they could accomplish on their own and what they need federal officials to provide — primarily, clear, well-calibrated public messaging<b>. </b></p>
<p>Here are five things they identified that could go a long way toward fixing some of the early problems with the U.S. vaccination effort. <b> </b></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">1. Start a federal media campaign to combat vaccine hesitancy now.</h3>
<p>Local health care leaders want to see more leadership on vaccine confidence issues from Washington. After all, said Shereef Elnahal, CEO of University Hospital in Newark and former health commissioner for New Jersey, “the federal government has the advantage of scale and funding.” </p>
<p>What state and local officials really need is for the federal government to develop a national messaging toolkit, much like it did with the swine flu outbreak in 2009, that can be adapted and applied to different communities, said Greg Holzman, Montana state medical officer, who worked for Michigan during that pandemic. </p>
<p>“We can take that backbone, and then adapt it for our environment,” said Holzman. </p>
<p>That strategy could also draw from broad swathes of data supplied by states and localities that may suggest trends for outreach and trust, said Elnahal.</p>
<br />
<p>“If the CDC or different body were to invest in building an evidence basis for how to combat hesitancy, especially in communities of color ... [they could assess] whatever statistical data is associated with strategies that have worked” and develop a national toolkit, he said.</p>
<p>That would save critical time at the local level, argued Elnahal, whose city of Newark, which is majority Black and Latino, has struggled with Covid surges that at times far outpaced the rest of the state. “We tried strategies that didn’t work in the beginning.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">2. Microtarget minority communities.</h3>
<p>Early lags in getting historically underserved people vaccinated led Oregon to hash out culturally specific approaches and public health needs in the vaccination drive, such as targeted work with faith leaders and respected officials of Native American tribes. </p>
<p>“It's not just about vaccines. There's an entire historical context of governmental public health, the medical system and the medical distrust that folks have,” said Oregon's Banks. “We're dealing with whole communities, whole populations who want to be addressed in the whole vitality of their culture.”</p>
<br />
<p>There is a model for community trust in the eight Montana tribes, many of which live across seven reservations in the state, said Montana’s Holzman. The autonomous reservations have done a “fantastic job” with vaccination so far in large part because “working in communities, getting out and getting the information to the right people has made all the difference in the world.” </p>
<p>For Black communities, it is about reestablishing trust that’s been eroded by decades of neglect, said Elnahal. “There’s this concept that, look: You were able to generate the will, motivation and funding to develop a vaccine for this disease within a year, and yet we've been dealing with public health issues in our community for generations that you still have yet to solve?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">3. Redirect vaccine messages to focus on preventing hospitalization and death.</h3>
<p>Officials are excited about the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, because it will be far easier to distribute. But while the J&amp;J vaccine is super effective at preventing hospitalization and death, it is not as broadly effective against moderate disease as the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna shots that hit the market earlier and set an incredibly high bar. But as a tool to help halt the spread of the pandemic, participants said that it will be very valuable — as long as officials can prevent the public from getting the idea that it’s inferior to the alternatives. </p>
<p>The message that needs to come from public health officials at all levels, the hackers said, is that the goal of getting vaccinated is to prevent severe illness, not all illness. </p>
<p>“I wish people had a better understanding of its usefulness in preventing severe illness and death,” said Banks.</p>
<p>What’s more, news that variants of the coronavirus are spreading may raise public concern about the effectiveness of the vaccines — bringing questions about whether people will eventually need booster shots or new, targeted vaccines. In the short run, though, the more people are vaccinated with the existing vaccines, the less of a chance for further virus mutations. </p>
<p>“I think that's going to be a tremendous logistical challenge,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Georgetown University Medical Center. “It's also going to be very difficult to communicate to people why they should keep taking these vaccines.” </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">4. Partner with religious and community leaders.</h3>
<p>Most state and local leaders have recognized that relying on community leaders builds confidence and makes vaccination easier for many people, particularly those marginalized from the health care system. </p>
<p>Health officials have long relied on trust between patients and providers when it comes to major medical decisions and other public health measures such as childhood vaccinations. But many underserved people do not have a trusted doctor or pharmacist; for them, government leaders need to appeal to community, family and faith leaders. </p>
<br />
<p>“We have to almost make our vaccine messaging more contagious than the virus itself and turn all of those people into vaccine ambassadors,” said New York City’s Chokshi. “So that whoever someone is going to turn to, who they trust to make a decision like this one, they'll have the information that they need.”</p>
<p>But those kinds of efforts take an influx of state and local funding, said Plescia, because of needs to contract with local groups and hire more community-based workers for outreach. Those agreements with community-based organizations to help stoke confidence “are perhaps more important than PSAs and stuff you might see on TV.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left">5. Use mobile vans to go to the people you want to vaccinate.</h3>
<p>In the early stages, motivated residents have been willing to travel long distances to get vaccinated, but as the campaign shifts to focus more on hard-to-reach or reluctant communities, it will likely be more effective to bring the vaccine to people instead. Several officials discussed putting vaccines on the move, especially in the warmer months. Mobile vans could be a relatively easy option, especially with certain shots such as the refrigerated J&amp;J vaccine rather than ultra-cold Pfizer shots. </p>
<p>Vans could also be a way of vaccinating homebound populations that some, such as Chokshi, say they have struggled to reach in the early months of vaccination. They could also be helpful to reach people at their workplaces, particularly frontline workers in public-facing jobs, or people experiencing homelessness. </p>
<br />
<p>As vaccine supplies grow, health officials are looking forward to shifting away from mass vaccination sites and leaning more on federal quality health centers and community clinics that people in the nearby areas trust.</p>
<p>“We started out and we really pumped a lot of vaccine to high throughput sites,” said Oregon’s Banks. “And now we're saying that we need a varied distribution model, whether it’s mobile clinics, [federally qualified health centers] or to address the digital divide.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">LEARNING AS THEY GO</h2>
<br />
<p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>s the historic vaccination push continues nationwide, state and city leaders are learning as they go about the best methods to reach the country’s varied and diverse populations. Some are looking to others’ examples; others are learning from their own mistakes. </p>
<p>“I can tell you that every single day I am frustrated, my hair is getting grayer, but I always have to stop and look back and think about how we actually have done a lot, and a lot has been pretty impressive,” said Holzman.</p>
<br />
<p>The policy hackers who joined POLITICO were optimistic about outreach and community initiatives, but are bracing for even more challenges ahead both in convincing people to get vaccinated and securing steady supplies as the pandemic moves deeper into its second year. </p>
<p>“I think a lot of this could have been made easier if there had been more transparency and a more coherent plan from the federal government,” said Rasmussen. “I'm really encouraged, actually, hearing what everybody has done. It is really remarkable work, to do the best they can under incredibly difficult circumstances.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>House Democrats on Thursday blasted online brokerage Robinhood and trading giant Citadel Securities over their business models in a hearing that highlighted frustration from lawmakers about inequalities built into the structure of the stock market.</p>
<p>In the wake of the GameStop stock trading frenzy last month, lawmakers pressed Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev on how the popular retail trading app could claim it was providing the best possible prices for its small-dollar customers while selling their order information to sophisticated financial firms like Citadel Securities that grab the trades before they hit public exchanges.</p>
<p>“Citadel is one of the winners,” said Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), a former Goldman Sachs vice president. “They're the casino in this story, and the casino tends to win over time. Robinhood ... makes a lot of money from the casino.”</p>
<p>“So who loses?&quot; Himes said. &quot;The retail investor.”</p>
<p>The hearing before the House Financial Services Committee underscored how the GameStop episode has raised alarms among lawmakers and regulators over whether the complex structure of the market serves average investors or is fraught with conflicts of interest and susceptible to manipulation.</p>
<p>The video game retailer's stock price skyrocketed by more than 400 percent in late January, one of several struggling companies whose shares surged, in a bizarre buying binge apparently tied to a group of small investors on the social media website Reddit. The turmoil captured the attention of policymakers, particularly after Robinhood suddenly limited trading in GameStop and certain other equities, citing demands on the app to cough up $3 billion to back up its customers’ trades.</p>
<p>Lawmakers zeroed in on what is known as “payment for order flow,” the practice of selling customer orders to big trading firms that has attracted attention thanks to the Reddit-fueled rise in the shares of the troubled companies, a stock-buying frenzy that lasted roughly a week.</p>
<p>But both Robinhood and Citadel sharply defended their business arrangement as a way of lowering costs for retail traders; the profit Robinhood makes from selling customer information allows the broker to make enough money that it doesn’t have to charge commissions for its services, Tenev said.</p>
<p>“When we started, people didn't even think that there was enough margin left to make this business work, but we've been fortunate to make it work, and to make it work for our customers,” he said.</p>
<p>Citadel founder Kenneth Griffin, who also runs a separate hedge fund, called buying order flow information “a longstanding, transparent and regulated practice” and a key reason why fees have plummeted for retail investors.</p>
<p>Broker fees weren’t the only subject of concern for lawmakers. Other topics of discussion included collateral requirements for brokers, whether the speed at which trades are settled causes problems, and even whether the stock-buying boom among retail customers in the U.S. posed a national security risk as China seeks to attract similar investors with its own apps.</p>
<p>That was a primary concern for Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), who brought up how China-based Webull cut into Robinhood’s user base during the stock frenzy.</p>
<p>Zeldin said, as a result, it was possible that Chinese financial companies with ties to the ruling Communist Party were “receiving personally identifiable information or other user data” from subsidiaries licensed in the U.S. He said he had asked the Treasury Department about the potential national security concern.</p>
<p>But much of the hearing focused on the potential conflicts of interest posed by brokers selling order information to “market makers” like Citadel, which handles more than 40 percent of all retail trade volume, according to Griffin.</p>
<p>Committee Chair Maxine Waters pointed to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321" target="_blank">a $65 million settlement</a> paid by Robinhood in December to settle SEC charges that it failed to disclose millions in profits from selling customer orders to trading firms.</p>
<p>The SEC concluded that Robinhood’s claim of “commission-free” trades hid a larger cost from selling customer trades at high fees to other brokers. “Due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers’ orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers’ prices,” the SEC said.</p>
<p>According to the SEC’s order, the inferior trade prices deprived customers of $34.1 million — even after taking into account the savings from not paying a commission.</p>
<p>“Is it your testimony ... that this conflict of interest is in your customers’ best interest?” Waters asked Tenev. She also said Citadel’s business strategy was “designed intentionally to undermine transparency and skim profits from companies and other investors.”</p>
<p>“Regulatory compliance is at the center of everything that we do; we've made mistakes in the past,” Tenev countered before Waters cut him off because he didn’t provide a yes or no answer.</p>
<p>Tenev argued that by having orders from its customers executed by firms like Citadel Securities with more sophisticated technology that can trade faster, those customers had gained more than $1 billion in improved prices compared to what they would have gotten normally.</p>
<p>But Rep. Bill Foster (D-Ill.) said this figure didn’t measure whether customers could have gotten better prices from other brokers that also use high-frequency traders.</p>
<p>“It's very easy to make payment for order flow sound really creepy,” Foster said. “You’re basically selling a list of groups to the sharks.”</p>
<p>“On the other hand, you make part of an argument that this can net out positive for consumers,” he added. “But for it to fully net out positive they have to be able to make the apples to apples comparison.”</p>
<p>After hours of testimony, lawmakers hadn’t come to any policy conclusions about the issue. But Republicans argued throughout the day that the trading fiasco should not result in a push for more regulation until lawmakers and the SEC investigate more.</p>
<p>“My general view here is that you're not going to put technology back in the box, no matter how you try to regulate. You're not going to curb investor interest, no matter how much you want to curb it,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the committee’s top Republican. “The population is there, and no matter how dumb Washington politicians think the average investor is, they're a lot sharper than they appear.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>Ted Cruz was already treading on rough political terrain this week — then he boarded a flight to Cancun during a natural disaster.</p>
<p>The Texas Republican senator, condemned by opponents for objecting to November’s presidential election results even after rioters besieged the Capitol, fled his frozen home state for the sunny Mexican resort city on Wednesday while Texans reeled from winter storms that have left millions without electricity and running water. Cruz, who’s no stranger to controversies surrounding extreme weather events, took hours to acknowledge his trip as critics accused him of political malpractice at best and all-out negligence at worst — prompting him to return to Texas on Thursday.</p>
<p>“I have to admit, I started having second thoughts almost the moment I sat down on the plane,” Cruz said after landing back in Houston. “Frankly, leaving when so many Texans were hurting didn’t feel right, and so I changed my return flight and flew back on the first available flight I could take.”</p>
<p>When he finally addressed the furor earlier Thursday, Cruz said he flew to Cancun to accompany his daughters at their request and was flying back to the U.S. the next day. He initially did not clarify whether he had always intended the trip to last less than 24 hours, saying only that he “wanted to be a good dad” and “drop off” his daughters in Cancun. He later acknowledged that his trip was booked through the weekend.</p>
<p>His explanation quickly became its own social media punch line, with one House Democrat tweeting wryly that he needed to take his daughters to Cancun “so I can be a good father.” For a 2016 White House contender widely viewed as a potential 2024 hopeful, the mostly tight-lipped response from Cruz’s fellow Republicans underscored his long-standing status as one of the more polarizing figures in the Senate GOP.</p>
<p>The flap began Wednesday night, when photos surfaced on social media of Cruz waiting in line to board a flight from his home airport in Houston with his wife, Heidi, and their daughters. He left Texas as his constituents were dealing with unprecedented power outages and sub-freezing temperatures stemming from a series of devastating and ongoing winter storms, and Cruz decided to return home early after the backlash materialized.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://abc13.com/one-on-one-with-ted-cruz-after-returning-home-from-cancun-during-winter-crisis/10352150/" target="_blank">told</a> the local ABC station in Houston that he made a “mistake,” and later told Sean Hannity on Fox News that he ultimately came to the conclusion that “you need to be here on the ground.” He said his intention was to “work remotely” from Cancun through the weekend.</p>
<p>Text messages shared with POLITICO showed Heidi Cruz bemoaning the “FREEZING” temperatures after their house lost power earlier in the week. She asked neighbors and friends in a group text conversation whether they were interested in joining them on their trip.</p>
<br />
<p>“Anyone can or want to leave for the week?” Heidi Cruz asked, noting that hotels had openings and sharing the family’s flight itinerary.</p>
<p>Cruz’s counterpart in the Senate, John Cornyn, has been directing Texans to resources including shelters and food banks — and even re-tweeted a user who wrote a subtle contrast to Cruz: “Meanwhile, @JohnCornyn’s Twitter feed is full of helpful news and resources for Texas.”</p>
<p>Although nobody disputed that Cruz’s travels were politically risky, some Cruz allies, like Donald Trump Jr.,<a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1362483737624215552" target="_blank"> <u>defended</u></a> him by suggesting that senators have little power when it comes to “localized disasters.”</p>
<p>But lawmakers are typically eager to show their faces when their constituents are dealing with natural disasters or other tragedies — not only to show their commitment to voters, but to help lead response and recovery efforts. Senators in particular play critical roles, helping to coordinate work between the federal government and state and local municipalities while mobilizing their powerful constituent services arms.</p>
<p>Cruz, however, has stumbled before during weather-related emergencies. When Hurricane Sandy battered the northeast in 2012, he vocally opposed a relief package to help those states rebuild, blasting it as a “Christmas tree” filled with unnecessary spending. But when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas in 2017, Cruz led the charge for an emergency spending bill to help his state and<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/28/texas-hurricane-harvey-hypocrisy-cruz-242098" target="_blank"> <u>faced questions from fellow lawmakers</u></a> — as well as then-GOP Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey — about the apparent double standard.</p>
<p>Texas in particular has been starving for resources from the federal government in the aftermath of the storms, which have caused severe damage to the state’s infrastructure and electric grids.</p>
<p>In an earlier statement, Cruz said he and his staff “are in constant communication with state and local leaders to get to the bottom of what happened in Texas.”</p>
<p>Cruz’s office was apparently planning for the trip ahead of time. A spokesperson for the Houston Police Department confirmed that a member of Cruz’s staff contacted the department Wednesday afternoon and requested law enforcement “assistance upon Sen. Cruz’s arrival” at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport.</p>
<p>The Senate is on a scheduled recess this week, with many senators returning to work in their home states. Meanwhile, winter storms have pummeled cities across Texas all week, leaving millions of residents unable to heat their homes or buy food.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=77mmmnr0tbE&amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;ab_channel=SenatorTedCruz" target="_blank"> <u>Cruz urged Texans during a Monday radio interview</u></a> to “just stay home” as the winter weather was bearing down on the state.</p>
<br />
<p>His political opponents hustled to use the Cancun flight against him.</p>
<p>“Cruz is emblematic of what the Texas Republican Party and its leaders have become: weak, corrupt, inept, and self-serving politicians who don’t give a damn about the people they were elected to represent,” Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. “They were elected by the people but have no interest or intent of doing their jobs.”</p>
<p>One liberal group began fundraising to send an electronic billboard to Cruz’s house that read, “Texans Froze. Ted Fled.”</p>
<p>Cruz is already facing a Senate Ethics Committee investigation, requested by Democrats, over his efforts to object to the Electoral College certification on Jan. 6, when a violent mob stormed the Capitol to prevent lawmakers from certifying Biden’s victory.</p>
<p>Even after the insurrection, Cruz maintained his objections to the certification even as some of his fellow Republicans backed away. Top Republicans including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell harangued the effort as a dangerous attempt to overturn the will of the voters.</p>
<p>While Cruz described his Cancun trip as a request from his children, at least one other parent at their school raised concerns about the getaway and inquired about whether Cruz’s family would have to quarantine after returning to the U.S., according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>“As with any other school family, they must QUARANTINE APPROPRIATELY upon their return, correct?” one parent wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>Beto O’Rourke, the Democrat Cruz defeated in 2018’s Texas Senate race, tweeted that he spent Wednesday night on a phone-banking effort to check in on senior citizens. O’Rourke also has been using his Twitter account to direct Texans toward shelters and food banks.</p>
<p>Texas grid operators said Thursday morning they have begun to restore power to most customers, but for nearly a week as many as 4 million residents of the Lone Star state lived without electric light or, in many cases electric heat, amid near-zero temperatures.</p>
<p>Pictures soon surfaced on social media of frost in living rooms and food on porches to keep it from spoiling while refrigerators had no power as residents struggled to stay warm amid the days-long power failure. By Wednesday night 7 million Texans were under boil water orders as water utilities working with reduced electricity supply struggled to keep up with demand.</p>

<br />
<p>PHILADELPHIA — Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey isn't running for reelection in 2022. But his vote to convict former President Donald Trump is already rocking the race to succeed him.</p>
<p>County parties have censured Toomey, prompting backlash from centrists and even some Trump supporters who think the efforts will hurt the GOP in upcoming elections. Former Rep. Ryan Costello, a moderate Republican eyeing a bid for the Senate, has publicly come to Toomey's defense in the wake of his vote. Former Trump aides, in turn, are making plans to torpedo Costello before he announces a campaign.</p>
<p>The turmoil is the latest evidence that Trump's departure from office has not at all diminished his role in the GOP — in Pennsylvania, in fact, the primary is likely to be a proxy fight between Trump loyalists and those who believe the former president damaged the party's ability to compete here.</p>
<p>“Any candidate who wants to win in Pennsylvania in 2022 must be full Trump MAGA,” said Steve Bannon, a former White House chief strategist to Trump.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth over Toomey’s vote is also exacerbating party fissures in a state where Republicans lost Senate and gubernatorial contests in 2018 and the presidential contest in 2020. The intraparty tensions could damage Republican prospects in 2022, when control of both the House and the Senate will be up for grabs. </p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Senate race in 2022 is a must-win seat for Republicans, and there will be a critical gubernatorial election that year in the state as well.</p>
<p>Sam DeMarco, GOP chair in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, said he strongly supports Trump and disagrees with Toomey’s vote to convict him. But he called the efforts to censure Toomey a “distraction” and believes that Democrats pursued the second impeachment of Trump explicitly to divide the GOP.</p>
<p>“At a time where we need to bring people into our tent, into our party, I worry that the attempts to censure or punish the senator for his vote would send the wrong signal to independents and other like-minded individuals who might lean Republican, but don’t think there’s a place in the party for them,” he said. “Politics is a numbers game. You only win through addition, not subtraction.”</p>
<p>Costello, who represented a suburban House seat before retiring in 2018, told POLITICO that the censures “will hurt Republican candidates.” On Twitter, he went further, saying that a proposed resolution to censure Toomey drafted by the Chester County GOP — his home county’s party — is &quot;staggeringly dumb&quot; and “will indisputably brand them in such a way that it will make it *more* difficult to win county-wide elections this year.”</p>
<p>Bill Bretz, leader of Westmoreland County’s Republican Party in Western Pennsylvania, said his committee members censured Toomey because they were “pretty outraged” and downplayed concerns that the admonishment would divert the party from working to win upcoming elections.</p>
<p>“We’re capable of walking and chewing bubble gum at the same time,” he said. &quot;We can express our dissatisfaction with his vote and still proceed accordingly with getting ready to get our statewide judges elected.”</p>
<p>It will be months until the Senate primary heats up, and some party operatives argued that Toomey’s vote is unlikely to have an impact on the election by the time voters go to the polls.</p>
<p>But as several Republicans fret over the political fallout of the party’s condemnation of Toomey, others are already battling over how the senator’s vote — and those who stood up for him — will be remembered by voters in 2022. Former Trump aides told POLITICO they are planning a public relations campaign against Costello, who has defended Toomey as a “foremost policy wonk” for GOP legislative priorities.</p>
<p>A person involved in the anti-Costello effort said their goal is to take on “Toomey plus people trying to follow in his form” in the party. Costello, a longtime Trump critic who is expected to launch an exploratory committee for the Senate in short order, brushed off the threat.</p>
<p>“They can say whatever they’d like, it won’t bother me,” he said. “It might help my fundraising, to be honest with you.”</p>
<p>Top Trump allies are also already openly criticizing Costello. </p>
<p>“Never Trumper Ryan Costello is a sellout to the globalists,” said Bannon in a statement that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/07/politics/southern-california-midterm-elections-congress/index.html" target="_blank">echoed Washington Republicans’ dissatisfaction</a> with Costello for declining to run again after a court redrew Pennsylvania’s congressional map. “I don’t always agree with the [National Republican Congressional Committee], but when their Chairman Steve Stivers said Ryan Costello lacked intestinal fortitude, I agreed.&quot;</p>
<p>Costello replied: &quot;Sloppy Steve will say whatever he's told [because] he's forever indebted for his pardon.&quot;</p>
<p>The national anti-Trump group Republican Accountability Project, meanwhile, is expected to launch a campaign to support Toomey and hopes that anti-MAGA Republicans will be encouraged to run for his seat in 2022.</p>
<p>Joe Gale, a Montgomery County commissioner who was an early Trump backer in 2016, launched a bid for governor this week bashing Toomey. He said in his announcement that the senator has a “track record of betraying President Trump” and that his brother, Sean, who is running for the open Senate seat, “will be the exact opposite of RINO Pat Toomey.”</p>
<p>The uproar over Toomey’s vote has also led to questions about the role he will play in attempting to influence the contest for his seat. Some pro-Trump Republicans predict that a stamp of approval from Toomey could be harmful in the Senate GOP primary. Toomey’s office declined to comment for this story. </p>
<p>Greg Manz, Trump’s 2020 communications adviser for strategy and a former spokesman for the Pennsylvania GOP, said Republican candidates who vie for Toomey’s endorsement or funding from his political action committee will be viewed unfavorably by pro-Trump activists.</p>
<p>A nod from the state party apparatus — whose members include many Trump loyalists — is seen as a significant benefit for primary candidates here.</p>
<p>“It would be foolish for any statewide candidate seeking the Pennsylvania GOP’s endorsement to accept Sen. Toomey’s endorsement or donations from him,” said Manz. “I imagine a feckless hack like Ryan Costello would gladly align himself with Sen. Toomey, but he won’t even place in the Senate primary. He’s a non-factor ultimately.”</p>
<p>In an indication of how divided the two flanks of the GOP are, Costello struck back at Manz with a scathing comment.</p>
<p>“Before Greg Manz worked for Trump, he worked at the state party. Everyone back then and before used to make fun of him [because] he’s a clown. No one respects him and a few years from now, he will probably be pumping gas in New Jersey,” he said. “No one knows who he is. He just does what he’s told like the little errand boy he is.”</p>
<p>Manz returned the barb: “People who disparage hard-working Americans, gas station attendants in this case, have no place in public office.” </p>
<p>Shortly after speaking with POLITICO, Costello took to Twitter to criticize Manz again. Jason Miller, Trump’s senior adviser, retweeted Costello and defended Manz, calling him “true #MAGA and a real-deal Patriot!&quot;<br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Congressional Democrats unveiled President Joe Biden’s expansive immigration reform bill Thursday, which would provide an eight-year pathway to citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants. But it already faces dim prospects for becoming law with such narrow Democratic majorities in both chambers. </p>
<p>The bill, introduced by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.), would create an expedited pathway for so-called Dreamers and other select undocumented immigrants. It also would increase the number of available diversity visas, and direct more funding to immigration courts and technology.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an economic and moral imperative to pass big, bold and inclusive immigration reform that leaves no one behind, not our Dreamers and [Temporary Protective Status] holders, not our farm workers and meat packers, not our essential workers and not our parents, friends and neighbors,&quot; Menendez said on a call with reporters Thursday.</p>

<br />
<p>Menendez alluded to past attempts and failures to pass big reforms. </p>
<p>&quot;We have compromised too much and capitulated too quickly to fringe voices who have refused to accept the humanity and contributions of immigrants to our country,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>In drafting a sweeping immigration bill early in his presidency, Biden is seeking to avoid what many Democrats viewed as a missed opportunity by former President Barack Obama to address the issue. The bill, which would also change the term “alien” to “noncitizen” in the country’s legal code, has been praised widely by progressives and immigrant rights advocates. But it's unlikely to gain any Republican support.</p>
<p>Though co-sponsors characterized the bill as a historic step by the administration to address an overtaxed immigration system, few on and off the Hill think it can pass a 50-50 Senate. </p>
<p>“This bill was not designed to get to 60,” said a person close to the White House who was briefed on the bill. “There’s no pathway to 60.”</p>
<p>White House officials wouldn’t say if Biden is considering passing elements of immigration reform through a second budget reconciliation process later this year or if they are already talking to lawmakers about passing smaller items. But they conceded the end result could be very different. </p>
<p>“He was in the Senate for 36 years and he’s the first to tell you the legislative process can look different on the other end of where it starts,” a White House official said on a call with reporters Wednesday evening. </p>
<p>Sources close to the White House have said for weeks that the administration is open to passing targeted bills that could be more likely to garner 60 votes. </p>

<br />
<p>Biden himself said as much during a town hall with CNN on Tuesday as he fielded questions on immigration. “There’s things I would deal with by itself,” he said. “But not at the expense of saying I’m never going to do the other.”</p>
<p>Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/11/house-democrats-biden-immigration-plan-468720" target="_blank">have been debating</a> for more than a month what to do when Biden’s sweeping immigration overhaul lands on Capitol Hill. Those talks have only intensified in recent weeks as more Democrats coalesced around the idea of passing more targeted legislation versus putting legislative muscle behind a comprehensive bill that has little chance of becoming law.</p>
<p>House Democratic leaders have yet to make a final decision but several lawmakers and senior aides told POLITICO they believe the chamber will first try to pass a bill that offers a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and immigrants from war-torn countries. A handful of Republicans crossed party lines and supported the bill last Congress.</p>
<p>&quot;I salute the president for putting forth the legislation that he did,&quot; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. &quot;There are others who want to do piecemeal and that may be a good approach today. That’s up for the Congress to decide.&quot;</p>
<p>The effort will likely happen the week of March 8 — the last time lawmakers will be in Washington to vote before a month of remote committee work and a two-week recess for Easter and Passover. House Democrats are also staring down an April 1 deadline to act — to bypass committee action, the party has to bring immigration-related bills that were passed last year to the floor by then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced a <a href="https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-and-graham-introduce-the-dream-act" target="_blank">narrow bill</a> providing a pathway to Dreamers with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) earlier this month. </p>
<p>The immigration debate is illustrative of the delicate dance Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) must navigate over the next two years: balancing demands for sweeping legislation from a liberal base with narrow majorities and calls for a more moderate approach from emboldened centrists who see themselves as a check on the left.</p>
<p>Even immigration advocates who support the contours of the bill say it is not as comprehensive as the 2013 immigration legislation. Specifically, it does not include broad provisions on border security or employment verification to appeal to Republicans, though it includes language on both. It includes some enforcement measures, including border technology to stop drug traffickers and increased penalties for employers who hired undocumented immigrants, but E-Verify, a system to check legal status, remains voluntary.</p>
<p>Few Republicans have expressed interest in working with Democrats on immigration. And a number of those who previously contributed to 2013 reform efforts have attacked Biden’s proposal as an “amnesty” bill. Some Democrats, representing districts along the U.S.-Mexico border, are worried that the administration’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/18/immigration-politics-democrats-469732" target="_blank">quick movement on immigration</a> and messaging could hurt their party politically. </p>
<p>But the bill’s co-sponsors and the administration say they are willing to listen to Democratic colleagues who may have quibbles with the bill. </p>
<p>Menendez defended the border security provisions. He said the U.S. is already spending more money on border patrol “than a combination of all other federal law enforcement agencies put together.” </p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki would not say if Biden is willing to add more funding for border security to the bill to woo Republicans. The president’s proposal represents a “reset” of the immigration reform conversation, she said, adding that the White House is “eager” for Republicans to join. The bill's co-sponsors also say they're willing to listen to Republican concerns. </p>
<p>“One of the key components of the bill is investing in smart security at our ports of entry and doing it in a way that's actually effective,” Psaki said. “The entire strategy of the last four years was to do funding for a wall that was not effective in securing our border.”</p>
<p>Some Hispanic Caucus members, advocates and economists have also increasingly urged the administration and congressional leaders to include a pathway to citizenship for undocumented essential workers in a second reconciliation package to bolster an economic recovery. </p>
<p>To pass immigration measures through the reconciliation process, they must meet the Senate’s budgetary rules, Pelosi said. If the measures passed the test, she said it “would be wonderful because then we wouldn’t need the 60 votes.”</p>
<p>Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) also endorsed the piecemeal approach Thursday. It doesn’t rule out simultaneously pursuing a comprehensive bill “on parallel paths,” she said.</p>
<p>“There is an urgency to doing a comprehensive bill that we all understand,” Jayapal told reporters. </p>
<p>“But we also understand the urgency of immigrants ... who have been in such a state of limbo for such a long time. And there is bipartisan support for that group,” Jayapal said, citing Dreamers and immigrants from war ravaged areas. </p>
<p>Jayapal and other progressives are urging Pelosi to put targeted bills related to those specific groups of immigrants on the floor before the April 1 deadline. </p>
<br />
<p>But not all Democrats agree with that approach. Menendez, the administration's chief co-sponsor in the Senate, said he strongly prefers an all-at-once strategy.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some in Congress from both parties who argue against going big on immigration reform,&quot; Menendez said on a call with press Thursday. &quot;[Some] say we should leave the bigger, tougher questions for another day pursuing narrow reforms that nibble at the edges and leave millions of people behind. Personally, I couldn’t disagree more with both approaches.&quot;</p>
<p>Still, Menendez acknowledged, Democrats likely won't reject other strategies. If parts of Biden’s bill can be attached to the reconciliation process, or garner enough votes for passage individually, Menendez said he'd support it. </p>
<p>“We are not foreclosing any pathway into which we can achieve robust immigration reform,” he said. </p>
<p>Sanchez, who is leading a group of seven House members in corralling support for the bill, echoed that sentiment. “Oftentimes the end result is not exactly the starting result,” she said. </p>
<p>The White House insisted its larger bill should come first in an effort to avoid the perception it is abandoning a comprehensive approach, according to two people briefed on the legislation. The White House has also been holding a series of conference calls with immigration advocates in the days before the bill was released, including ones with progressive groups Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, which provides services to immigrants and refugees, called the bill “a good symbolic gesture,” urging Congress instead to pass multiple smaller bills and use the reconciliation process.</p>
<p>“What we still need is leadership that will ensure there is a path to victory before the end of this year,” said Erika Andiola, chief advocacy officer at RAICES. “Now is the time for Democrats to use every tool at their disposal to provide protection to the immigrant community without relying on the party of Trump and without compromising on further inhumane enforcement.” <br /></p>]]></content:encoded>

        <media:title>Then-U.S. Ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands in Copenhagen in December 2017.</media:title>
        <media:thumbnail url="https://static.politico.com/95/30/8e511b73487cb75deb21b6ae3528/ap17349504155131-c.jpg"/>

<br />
<p>Donald Trump’s ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, violated federal law when she urged Americans to donate to her boss’s campaign using her official Twitter account.</p>
<p>She did it again when she tweeted — once more from her official account — an article questioning whether Kamala Harris, the daughter of immigrants, was eligible to be vice president. </p>
<p>And yet again when she tweeted that Joe Biden was using the coronavirus pandemic for politics.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that Sands left her job last month. The federal agency that investigates allegations of federal employees using their platform to engage in politics <a href="https://osc.gov/Documents/Hatch%20Act/Reports/Report%20of%20Prohibited%20Political%20Activity%2c%20Carla%20Sands%2c%20HA-20-000091.pdf" target="_blank">reported to Biden last week</a> that her tweets ran afoul of the 80-year-old Hatch Act. </p>
<p>The Office of Special Counsel is investigating more than a dozen allegations of Hatch Act violations against high-profile Trump appointees even though they left office before Biden was sworn in as president, according to four people familiar with the cases. </p>
<p>That’s put Biden in a bind. He’s eager to move on from the investigations of the previous administration after Trump’s second impeachment trial <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/13/biden-trump-after-impeachment-469005" target="_blank">cast a shadow</a> over the first few weeks of his presidency. But House Democrats and government watchdog groups say it’s important to hold past officials accountable for their actions, arguing it will help prevent similar behavior in the future. </p>
<p>Sands, a former socialite, B-list movie star and chiropractor, unwittingly found herself in the spotlight after Trump started musing about trying to buy Greenland from Denmark. Her repeated retweeting of partisan news stories may have made her among the less discreet figures from the Trump era to be accused of violating the Hatch Act. But there were many others. </p>
<p>Most of them, including former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Trump’s daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who both served as White House advisers, and former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, are accused of promoting Trump on TV or Twitter. Others are accused of engaging in politics during the Republican National Convention and on Election Day when political events were held at the White House.</p>
<br />
<img src="https://static.politico.com/d0/4f/3efcfea340c699bcdfc449620a9e/200101-javanka-gty-773.jpg" />
<br />
<p>“The Hatch Act matters because our public servants must serve all Americans, not be a concierge service for crooked politicians,” said Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.), who requested one of the investigations and expects to introduce a bill strengthening the Hatch Act in the coming weeks. “The Trump’s regime’s assault on the rule of law has crushed public trust in government that must be restored.”</p>
<p>The White House is reviewing the report about Sands, according to an official. Neither Sands, a major Trump donor <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/28/trump-donor-campaigns-463363" target="_blank">who is weighing a campaign for Senate in Pennsylvania</a>, nor her attorney responded to messages. In a written response to OSC, Sands’ attorney states that they disagree with the agency’s “legal analysis and conclusions.”</p>
<p>The White House did not address the other outstanding investigations. But the OSC has penalties it could administer and Biden and fellow Democrats have several options available, too. The president could ban former federal employees who violate the Hatch Act, including Sands, from serving in the federal government again — or if they tried to return in a future administration, the Senate could hold up their confirmation or the oversight agency could pursue additional penalties.</p>
<p>If a federal official is still employed, the Office of Special Counsel often resolves cases by issuing a warning letter. Sometimes it works with an agency to negotiate disciplinary action — perhaps with a fine or suspension — or sends a case to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which hears cases of federal workers. With respect to Trump officials, some Democrats feel it’s imperative to have a public resolution of the outstanding cases. </p>
<p>“I worry a lot about where crimes may have been committed that turning a blind eye to them may set a precedent,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a member of the House Oversight Committee. “If we ignore it the way some people seem to be saying we should, then you guarantee this could happen again.”</p>
<p>The Hatch Act, named for a former New Mexico senator, restricts federal employees — aside from the president and vice president — from certain political behavior that could include tweeting certain messages, speaking about candidates, diverting official travel to attend political events and fundraising. It was enacted in 1939 after Democrats faced allegations of deploying Works Progress Administration employees to influence elections the year prior. </p>
<p>Formal Hatch Act complaints to the OSC have <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/05/15/trump-staff-campaign-complaints-1318864" target="_blank">jumped more than 40 percent</a> since Barack Obama’s last year in office. In total, the number of official complaints steadily rose from 197 in fiscal year 2016 to 253 in 2017; 263 in 2018 and 281 in 2019, the <a href="https://osc.gov/Documents/Resources/Congressional%20Matters/Annual%20Reports%20to%20Congress/FY%202019%20Annual%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf" target="_blank">most recent data available</a>. And watchdog groups say complaints involve more higher-profile staffers than ever before. At least a dozen Trump senior officials have violated the Hatch Act.</p>
<p>The agency <a href="https://osc.gov/Documents/Hatch%20Act/Policies/Policy%20When%20the%20Subject%20Official%20Leaves%20Government%20Service.pdf" target="_blank">generally closes cases after a federal worker leaves office</a>, given its limited resources — it has just seven attorneys. But it could keep a case open if an inquiry is already underway, if the accusations are egregious, or if officials think it could help educate employees, prevent a recurrence or correct a problem, according to an OSC official familiar with the Hatch Act.</p>
<p>After President George W. Bush left office in 2009, the agency <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/01/report-bush-staff-violated-hatch-act-048072" target="_blank">determined that some of his aides</a> violated the Hatch Act by taking political trips at taxpayer expense while claiming they were traveling on official business. Bush was asked to repay the government.</p>
<p>What’s different now is the sheer number of former employees — many of them high-ranking —under investigation following the swearing in of a new president. </p>
<p>In addition to DeVos, Ivanka Trump, Kushner and McEnany, the agency is investigating a variety of other former officials, most after complaints were lodged by the group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, according to group spokesperson Jordan Libowitz. The list includes: Robert O’Brien, national security adviser; Ja’Ron Smith, deputy assistant to the president and deputy director of the Office of American Innovation; Alyssa Farah, communications director; Larry Kudlow, National Economic Council director; Dan Brouillette, Energy secretary; John Ratcliffe, director of national intelligence; Marc Short, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff; David Friedman, ambassador to Israel; Brian Morgenstern, deputy press secretary and Karoline Leavitt, assistant White House press secretary. </p>
<p>Scott Peterson, the head of investigative watchdog blog Checks and Balances Project, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/21/betsy-devos-hatch-act-investigation-419471" target="_blank">lodged a complaint against DeVos</a> after she slammed Biden for promising to roll back her school choice policies in a Fox News interview, which her department subsequently promoted. This week, Peterson said OSC confirmed it was still investigating the case. </p>
<br />
<p>The House Oversight Committee filed a complaint with OSC after Trump <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/20/trump-rnc-speech-399483" target="_blank">formally accepted his party’s nomination</a> for president at the White House during the Republican National Convention in August. First lady Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump also delivered speeches from the White House while Pence spoke from another federal property, Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Md., best known as the site of a major battle in the War of 1812. The House Appropriations and Foreign Affairs committees filed a separate complaint after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed the convention while on an official visit to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>OSC is looking into those allegations. A House Oversight Committee aide said Congress is waiting for the conclusion of the investigations to determine how the law can be strengthened. “We need OSC’s independent assessment of what happened in order to effectively craft reforms,” the aide said.</p>
<p>In 2019, 65 federal employees — both political and career — <a href="https://osc.gov/Documents/Resources/Congressional%20Matters/Annual%20Reports%20to%20Congress/FY%202019%20Annual%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf" target="_blank">violated the Hatch Act</a>. Most of them (49) received warning letters while others were subject to disciplinary or corrective action, according to OSC. </p>
<p>Zachary Kurz, an OSC spokesperson, said the agency cannot comment on or confirm the status of Hatch Act investigations.</p>
<p>Nick Schwellenbach, who used to work at the Office of Special Counsel and now serves as director of investigations at the Project on Government Oversight, said former employees who violate the Hatch Act can face serious consequences if they try to return to the federal government.</p>
<p>The agency can revive their case because the Hatch Act has no statute of limitations and try to prosecute the employee in front of the Merit Systems Protection Board, he said. Or if the position requires Senate confirmation, the agency could make a recommendation that could make that difficult, he said.</p>
<p>The president is only tasked with determining if a staffer should be punished in rare high-profile cases, according to the OSC official. Many of the pending cases of Trump appointees would fit that description.</p>
<p>In 2019, the agency <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/13/federal-agency-recommends-that-kellyanne-conway-be-removed-from-service-over-hatch-act-1364221" target="_blank">recommended Trump fire one of his top aides, Kellyanne Conway</a>, after she repeatedly used her office for political purposes — the first time it has made such a recommendation for a White House official. </p>
<p>Trump declined.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<p>The extreme weather that forced power outages from North Dakota to Texas on Tuesday triggered a bout of the usual finger-pointing about the causes. But it could also deliver a boost to President Joe Biden’s efforts to upgrade infrastructure, counter climate change and expand the reach of renewable energy.</p>
<p>As millions of Texans shivered in the dark, supporters of the fossil fuel industries turned their ire on the state’s massive — and frozen — wind farms, even as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott acknowledged that the extreme cold had shut down all types of power plants, including those that burn coal. Data showed that the freeze hit the state’s natural gas power plants the hardest.</p>
<p>What most experts saw was the Texas grid’s vulnerability to harsh weather — and a warning that climate change-induced disasters could devastate the nation’s leading energy producer.</p>
<p>The resulting crisis could be a boon to Biden’s proposal to spend huge sums of money to harden the nation’s electric grid as it connects giant wind and solar power plants to cities and states thousands of miles away. That’s an essential step if the U.S. is to make a major turn toward relying on solar, wind and other renewable energy to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>“When supply doesn't show up, legislative or regulatory intervention begins,” said Kevin Book, managing director at the consulting firm ClearView Energy Partners. “The reactivity to a supply shock is one of the few things you can rely on.”</p>
<p>Freezing temperatures sent energy demand soaring in Texas to levels that eclipsed even the hottest summer days. Grid operators there and across the Midwest implemented rolling blackouts to prevent further damage to the grid, but in Texas alone 4 million customers have been without power since Monday.</p>
<p>Investigations of the causes are just beginning, but data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates the state’s electric grid, showed that at least 30 gigawatts of power fueled by natural gas, coal and nuclear went off line Monday, along with 16 gigawatts of renewable power.</p>
<p>National Republicans — and those with national aspirations — seized on pictures of frozen wind turbines to hammer Washington’s green energy agenda, even though Texas operates a grid outside of federal oversight and has spent decades making its own energy decisions.</p>
<p>“If the last few days have proven anything, it’s that we need oil &amp; gas, ”<a href="https://twitter.com/georgepbush/status/1361694974916591626?s=20" target="_blank">tweeted</a> George P. Bush, who as Texas Land Commissioner oversees much of the state’s oil and gas production. “Relying solely on renewable energy would be catastrophic. Many of these sources have proven to be unreliable.”</p>
<p>&quot;Texas is frozen solid as folks are left w/ no power to stay safe &amp; warm,&quot; Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) tweeted Tuesday. &quot;This is a perfect example of the need for reliable energy sources like natural gas &amp; coal.&quot;</p>
<p>But the extreme cold shut down a large share of those fossil fuel sources, too. Natural gas wellheads froze, and coal and nuclear generators in Texas were thrown off line, as <a href="https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1361398774216744967" target="_blank">Abbott himself acknowledged</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, the national debate about green energy versus fossil fuels is no longer what it was 10 or 20 years ago. The balance of power has shifted as the auto industry, Wall Street and even some fossil fuel companies line up behind renewables and move to shape the multibillion-dollar transition to cleaner energy, a shift they defend on economic grounds.</p>
<p>“Wind and solar and, increasingly, storage are the most cost-competitive options on the grid,” said Jeff Dennis, a managing director at Advanced Energy Economy, a national association of big power users and other businesses that advocates for clean energy. “There’s a real case to be made for rapidly scaling our investment in those technologies to improve both our reliability and our resilience.”</p>
<p>The shift has made the usual Washington energy blame-game less one-sided. Biden’s allies in and out of government spread the message that the Arctic blast showed the urgency of countering climate change and was another taste of the disasters the nation can expect from extreme weather.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to think how our overall infrastructure can accommodate increasingly common uncommon events,&quot; said Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.). &quot;It's tragic that so many people on the other side of the aisle are using it to bash renewables.&quot;</p>
<p>Clean energy groups were quick to provide support for Democrats. The American Council on Renewable Energy, a clean energy business trade group, said specific regional conditions worsened the crisis in Texas: The state’s grid, though geographically large, is almost entirely cut off from the rest of the country, so it could not draw power from other regions. In contrast, parts of the Midwest that avoided Texas’ fate are members of regional power networks linked by high-voltage transmission lines.</p>
<p>ACORE said expanding those interregional power lines would make the grid more resilient, preventing future crises.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s time for Congress to pass an ambitious infrastructure initiative aimed at expanding and upgrading America’s grid,&quot; Greg Wetstone, ACORE's CEO, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Biden plan aims to green the economy and is likely to include money for additional transmission lines, weatherization, battery storage, burial of power lines and other improvements to the electrical grid.</p>
<p>“[The grid] really is the uber-infrastructure and we need to ensure that it is resilient,” said Melanie Kenderdine, a principal at the Energy Futures Initiative and former head of the Energy Department's Office of Energy Policy and Systems Analysis under President Barack Obama. “We need to think about undergrounding key critical electricity infrastructure. Expensive? Yes, but so was the entire state of Texas shutting down.”</p>
<p>Bill Magness, CEO of ERCOT, which runs the state’s grid, said the extreme weather was &quot;unprecedented&quot; in the operator's existence, but that as of Tuesday evening the operator had restored some power. Despite another storm in the forecast, slightly higher temperatures should allow more generators to come back online.</p>
<p>The White House, meanwhile, was avoiding getting drawn into the debate Tuesday.</p>
